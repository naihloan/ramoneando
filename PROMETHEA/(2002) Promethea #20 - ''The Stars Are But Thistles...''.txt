-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAPTION: THERE IS NO OTHER SIDE, JUST ENDLESS FALLING, MINUTES OF IT, HOURS, WAITING FOR IMPACT THAT WILL NEVER COME.

CAPTION: AFTER JUST TEN MINUTES TOO HOARSE, TOO EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED NOW TO EVEN SCREAM.

CAPTION: THREE HOURS LATER THERE COMES BLACKOUT, COMES UNCONSCIOUSNESS...

CAPTION: THERE COMES AWAKENING.

CAPTION: FALLING WAS A DREAM, AND THE REALITY IS THIS FLOURESCENT DESERT. BARREN EERINESS EXTENDS TO THE HORIZON, IF THERE IS ONE.

CAPTION: NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO WALK WITHOUT DIRECTION FOR PERHAPS A SUNLESS DAY UNTIL, AT LAST, DESPAIRING SLEEP...

CAPTION: AND FALLING.

CAPTION: OBVIOUSLY THE DESERT HAS BEEN ONLY FANTASY, THE COMPENSATION CLUTCHED AT BY MINDS DESPERATE TO ESCAPE PLUMMETING HORROR.

CAPTION: THIS TIME, MORE ACCUSTOMED, PASSING OUT TAKES LONGER. ONLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WEEPING INTO SLIPSTREAM DO THE EYES CLOSE...

CAPTION: OPENING TO THE COLD SLAP OF WHITECAP.

CAPTION: SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THE CLIFFTOP LEAP INTO THIS DARK, GREAT SEA. ALL ELSE, THE PLUNGE, THE WASTELAND, WAS HALLUCINATION BORN OF ICY WATER AND FATIGUE.

CAPTION: SWIM ON. STRUGGLE TO STAY AFLOAT, AWAKE, NOT SLIP INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS...

CAPTION: AND FALLING.

CAPTION: FALLING.

CAPTION: FALLING.

SOPHIE: AHUAAAAUH*

SOPHIE: OHH, GOD.

SOPHIE: DREAMING. I WAS DREAMING AGAIN, OR ELSE THIS IS...

SOPHIE: W-WE WERE STILL FALLING, WEREN'T WE?

BARBARA: YEAH.

BARBARA: COME ON. LET'S KEEP MOVING.

HEADING: PROMETHEA

SOPHIE: BARBARA, THERE'S NO POINT. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WE'RE LOST.

SOPHIE: GOD HELP ME, I WISH I WAS DEAD.

BARBARA: I'M ALREADY DEAD. I JUST WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN.

BARBARA: LOOK AT THIS PLACE. IT'S HORRIBLE. THESE RADIOACTIVE WEEDS, THESE BUSTED UP PAVING SLABS...

SOPHIE: THEY'RE NOT PAVING SLABS. JUST ROCKS, SOME ACCIDENT IN HOW THEY LOOK.

SOPHIE: WE JUMPED OVER THE EDGE OF EVERYTHING. THERE'S NO PATHWAYS OUT HERE.

BARBARA: WELL, COULDN'T THERE ONCE HAVE BEEN A PATH OR SOMETHING?

BARBARA: THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THEM HIGHWAY MARKERS.

SOPHIE: IT...GOD. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT DOES...BUT IT'S SO CORRODED YOU CAN'T READ IT ANYMORE.

SOPHIE: I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IN ALL JACK FAUST'S BOOKS, IT SAYS THERE'S NO PATH ACROSS FROM THE FOURTH SPHERE...

SOPHIE: IT'S...IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERE USED TO BE A PATH HERE, LIKE YOU SAID.

SOPHIE: BUT...I MEAN, TAROT PATHS AREN'T JUST ROADWAYS. THEY'RE THE CONNECTIONS OF OUR SOULS.

SOPHIE: WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED TO IT?

BARBARA: I CAN SEE SOMETHING UP AHEAD...

BARBARA: SOPHIE? YOU BETTER COME LOOK AT THIS...

BARBARA: WHAT DOES THIS SAY? "HE...FAR"? "HE...EAR"? I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT.

ON STATUE: THE (?)AR

SOPHIE: "THE BEGGAR." THE STATUE LOOKS LIKE IT USED TO BE A BEGGAR . BUT THERE'S NO SUCH TAROT CARD.

SOPHIE: BARBARA, WE'RE RIGHT OFF THE MAP HERE.

BARBARA: I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS KABALLAH BUSINESS WAS A MAP OF EVERYTHING?

SOPHIE: IT IS...BUT HERE, THE ABYSS, THERE'S JUST SORT OF A GAP.

SOPHIE: "THE BEGGAR." IT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING.

SOPHIE: OR...I DUNNO. MAYBE IT MEANT SOMETHING ONCE, BUT DOESN'T ANYMORE.

BARBARA: ALL I CAN REMEMBER WITH BEGGARS IS THOSE OLD STORIES WHERE KINGS AND GODS AND STUFF DISGUISE THEMSELVES.

SOPHIE: YEAH . WHEN THEY WANT TO ENTER THE ORDINARY HUMAN WORLD OR SOMETHING.

SOPHIE: I GUESS THIS ABYSS IS WHERE GOD'S ENERGY ENTERS THE UNIVERSE FROM...

BARBARA: SO...LEMME SEE, THERE'S JUST SPHERE FOUR, THEN THIS ABYSS THING, THEN SPHERE THREE ON THE OTHER SIDE?

BARBARA: THERE'S NOTHING IN-BETWEEN?

SOPHIE: WELL...SOME BOOKS MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED THE FALSE SEPHIROTH, OR THE INVISIBLE SEPHIROTH.

SOPHIE: IT LOOKED HARD, SO I SKIPPED IT.

ON ARCH: DAATH

SOPHIE: ACTUALLY, THINKING ABOUT IT, THAT WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE.

BARBARA: WH-WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

SOPHIE: I--I DON'T THINK IT IS A PLACE. NOT ANY MORE.

SOPHIE: IT'S LIKE WHATEVER WAS HERE JUST...I DUNNO. COLLAPSED OR SOMETHING.

BARBARA: BUT...THESE SPHERES ARE WHOLE STATES OF BEING, RIGHT? HOW COULD ONE COLLAPSE?

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW.

SOPHIE: I THINK THAT SAYS "DAATH," OVER THE ARCH.

BARBARA: "DAATH?" WHAT, LIKE DAATH VADER?

SOPHIE: I THINK IT'S A HEBREW WORD THAT MEANS "KNOWLEDGE." IT'S...

SOPHIE: AAUUGH! WHAT'S THAT?

BARBARA: WHAT'S WHAT?

SOPHIE: I...THERE WAS SOME SCUTTLING THING, RAN BEHIND THAT MASONRY?

SOPHIE: IT WAS LIKE THIS DAYGLO CENTIPEDE...

SOPHIE: HEY. THAT'S IT. DAYGLO. THIS PLACE IS SORT OF COLORED LIKE BLACK LIGHT.

SOPHIE: MAYBE "INVISIBLE" SEPHIROTH MEANS ULTRA-VIOLET?

BARBARA: HEY! I SEE SOMEBODY!

SOPHIE: YOU'RE RIGHT. IT...IT'S SOMEBODY ON A CAMEL.

SOPHIE: AND THEY'RE ON SOME SORT OF PATH THROUGH THESE RUINS...

BARBARA: HEY! HEY, YOU!

BARBARA: WAIT UP!

ALICE: YES?

BARBARA: UH, EXCUSE US, LADY, BUT WE'RE SORT OF LOST OUT HERE. WE WONDERED IF YOU COULD MAYBE...

SOPHIE: BARBARA, WAIT. THAT'S NOT A WOMAN. IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A GUY, OR...

SOPHIE: OH JEEZ.

SOPHIE: A-ARE YOU ALEISTER CROWLEY?

ALICE: WHY, WHATEVER DO YOU GIRLS MEAN? WHEN I'M LIKE THIS, YOU CAN CALL ME ALICE.

ALICE: YOU SEE, I'M RIDING ROUTE THIRTEEN, GIMEL, THE HIGH PRIESTESS, UP TO THE CROWN.

ALICE: HERE, MAGICIANS BECOME MAGIC ITSELF. THE PENETRATOR BECOMES THE PENETRATED.

ALICE: MALE BECOMES FEMALE.

SOPHIE: "GIMEL." THAT'S THE PATH FROM TIPHERETH TO KETHER. DOESN'T IT MEAN CAMEL, IN HEBREW?

BARBARA: WAIT A MINUTE... SO THIS HIGH PRIESTESS PATH YOU'RE ON, YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL IT IN DRAG?

ALICE: GOODNESS, NO. I'M EVERY BIT THE WOMAN YOU ARE, DEAR.

ALICE (OFF PANEL): LOOK...

ALICE (OFF PANEL): YOU SEE? THAT PRETTY LITTLE "V" WITH A CLEFT? JUST LIKE YOURS.

BARBARA: UHH...

ALICE (OFF PANEL): DO YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD SOME MEN... THE AWFUL, VULGAR CREATURES...REFER TO IT AS "THE CAMEL'S HOOF?"

ALICE (OFF PANEL): ANYWAY, I CAN'T STAND HERE GOSSIPING WITH YOU ALL NIGHT. I'VE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE CROWN OF CREATION, AND...

ALICE (OFF PANEL): OH, I SAY! ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

ALICE (OFF PANEL): JUST THERE, IN THE SAND BEHIND ME.

ALICE: SEE! FIVE FOOTPRINTS OF A CAMEL...

ALICE: V. V. V. V. V.

ON GROUND: V V V V V

ALICE: TOODLE-PIP, DEARIES.

SOPHIE: "V.V.V.V.V." I--I THINK I HEARD THAT BEFORE SOMEWHERE...

BARBARA: GOD. WAS THAT £$%&ED UP, OR WHAT?

BARBARA: HEY, WHY CAN'T WE FOLLOW THAT PRIESTESS PATH LIKE HE...LIKE SHE'S

BARBARA: DOING? IT'S GOTTA BEAT THIS GODDAMN PLACE.

SOPHIE: BECAUSE ROUTE THIRTEEN HEADS UP TO SPHERE ONE, KETHER, THE CROWN, AND THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'RE GOING.

SOPHIE: WE'RE FOLLOWING STEVE, AND BOO-BOO THOUGHT HE'D HAVE HEADED ACROSS THIS ABYSS TO SPHERE THREE.

SOPHIE: BESIDES, I WANT TO LOOK AT THESE RUINS.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, I REALLY MISS BOO-BOO. IT'S LIKE I GOT THIS HOLE IN ME WHERE SHE'S NOT.

SOPHIE: YEAH. I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT PROMETHEA.

SOPHIE: HEY, LOOK AT THIS CARVING OF THE PLANETS. THERE'S AN EXTRA ONE, BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER.

SOPHIE: THAT'D BE WHERE THE ASTEROID BELT IS NOW.

SOPHIE: DO YOU THINK IT'S THE PLANET THAT ONCE REPRESENTED THIS SPHERE? THAT THEY BOTH GOT DESTROYED?

BARBARA: I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST AFRAID THAT WE'RE...

BARBARA: OH, £$%&! AW, THAT'S £$%&ING GROSS!

SOPHIE: WHAT? WHAT WAS IT? WAS IT ANOTHER OF THOSE CENTIPEDE THINGS?

BARBARA: IT ... IT WAS MORE A JELLYFISH, OR... I DUNNO. SOME ANIMAL THAT NEVER EXISTED.

BARBARA: IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING H.P.LOVECRAFT PULLED OUT OF HIS NOSE.

SOPHIE: MAYBE THEY'RE THE ANIMALS OF THIS PLACE, AND IT'S LIKE WITH THAT EXTRA PLANET.

SOPHIE: THE THINGS THAT SYMBOLIZE THIS PLACE DON'T REALLY EXIST ANYMORE.

BARBARA: WHAT ABOUT THAT, OVER THERE? IS THAT THIS PLACE'S NUMBER?

SOPHIE: I--I GUESS SO. SEPHIROTH MEANS NUMBER, SO EVEN IF THIS PLACE IS A FALSE SEPHIROTH, IT SHOULD HAVE A NUMBER.

SOPHIE: THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ELEVEN...AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE CALL DAATH THE ELEVENTH SEPHIROTH.

IN BACKGROUND: II

BARBARA: WHAT, ELEVEN COMES BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR?

SOPHIE: YEAH, THAT SEEMS WRONG, DOESN'T IT? SPHERE THREE ONE SIDE OF THE ABYSS, SPHERE FOUR ON THE OTHER,AND ELEVEN BETWEEN THEM.

SOPHIE: BUT THEN, THERE ISN'T A NUMBER BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR. I GUESS ANYTHING WOULD SOUND WRONG.

BARBARA: WHAT ABOUT PI?

SOPHIE: PI? BUT, LIKE, PI CAN'T EVER BE CALCULATED EXACTLY, SO IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL NUMBER.

BARBARA: WELL, THEN, THAT MAKES IT A FALSE NUMBER, RIGHT? A FALSE SEPHIROTH.

BARBARA: PLUS, IT'S BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR. AIN'T IT THREE POINT ONE-SEVEN SOMETHING?

SOPHIE: GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND IF YOU KNOCKED THE TOP CROSSBAR OFF THE PI SYMBOL, IT'S THAT "ELEVEN" WE SAW.

SOPHIE: AND BECAUSE CALCULATING PI GOES ON FOREVER, I GUESS THAT LIKE THE ABYSS, IT'S SORT OF BOTTOMLESS...

BARBARA: HUH?

BARBARA: JESUS, SOPHIE, LOOK OUT...

BARBARA: I--IT'S LIKE A BLACK HOLE, EXCEPT IT'S MAUVE...

SOPHIE: I--I THINK IT'S A HOLE THROUGH THE ENTIRE TREE.

SOPHIE: WE HAVE TO GO AROUND IT.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): BUT... THAT'S LIKE A HOLE THROUGH EXISTENCE. WHERE DOES IT LEAD?

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE TREE, MAYBE? WHERE THINGS LIKE THAT LIVE?

BARBARA: I-IT FEELS LIKE A HOLE THROUGH ME. I'M GETTING THIS LUMP IN MY THROAT...

SOPHIE: UH, BARBARA?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, UP AHEAD. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE...

BARBARA: A BLACK TOWER.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, FOR SAYIN' THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE NOTHIN' HERE, THIS PLACE IS PRETTY SCENIC.

SOPHIE: W-WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK IT OUT.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, I DON'T KNOW.MAYBE SOMETHING BAD LIVES THERE.

SOPHIE: WELL, THAT LOOKS LIKE A REGULAR PERSON WAITING OUTSIDE TO WELCOME US.

SOPHIE: IN FACT...

SOPHIE: OH. IT'S YOU.

SOPHIE: HELLO AGAIN.

BARBARA: A-AUSTIN?

BARBARA: AUSTIN SPARE. IT IS. IT'S YOU. GOD, YOU'RE SO MUCH YOUNGER. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL...

AUSTIN: OF THIS I KNOW NOTHING. OF THIS, NOTHING MAY BE SAID.

SOPHIE: H-HE SAID HE WOULDN'T KNOW US IF WE MET AGAIN.

SOPHIE: MR. SPARE? WE'RE PILGRIMS.

SOPHIE: CAN YOU TELL US WHERE WE ARE?

AUSTIN: WE ARE NOT IN NON-EXISTENCE,NEITHER ARE WE IN THAT EXISTENCE WHICH IS GOD, NEITHER THAT WHICH IS NOT GOD.

AUSTIN: THIS IS THE TOWER OF THE ADEPTS, THE BLACK BROTHERS, AND IT IS AT DAATH.

AUSTIN: NO LIGHT IS HERE EMITTED.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, I DON'T LIKE THIS. THIS AIN'T LIKE THE OTHER PLACES WE'VE BEEN. THEY ALL MADE SENSE...

SOPHIE: I--I THINK THAT IF DAATH MEANS KNOWLEDGE, IT'S A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT'S BEYOND SENSE.

SOPHIE: MR.SPARE? CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT DAATH? HOW DID IT GET LIKE THIS?

AUSTIN: DAATH, IN THE GREAT BEGINNING, WAS A SEPHIROTH AS TRUE AS ANY. PATHS LED TO AND FROM IT, BOTH THE BEGGAR AND THE FOUNTAIN.

AUSTIN: THEN, THE TREE WAS OF A WHOLE. GOD WAS NOT SEPARATED FROM GOD'S UNIVERSE.

AUSTIN: NOW CAME THE FALL. NOW CAME THE CATACLYSM.

AUSTIN: THE LIGHTNING ENERGIES OF GOD, DESCENDING, OVERWHELMING THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTENCE.

AUSTIN: ITS LOWER SPHERES WERE BROKEN FROM THE THREE DIVINE SUPERNALS.

AUSTIN: WHERE DAATH HAD BEEN WAS NOW A DREADFUL ABSENCE.

AUSTIN: WAS A MARVELOUS CRACK IN EVERYTHING.

SOPHIE: OH JESUS. YOU MEAN...THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, ALL OF EXISTENCE...

SOPHIE: ...IT BROKE IN HALF? WE'RE LIVING IN A BROKEN COSMOS BECAUSE OF THIS...THIS FALL. THIS DISASTROUS ACCIDENT...

AUSTIN: THE THREE HEADS OF GOD WERE SUNDERED FROM EXISTENCE. WHO SHALL SAY THAT THIS WAS ACCIDENT?

AUSTIN: AND LIKEWISE, WHO SHALL SAY THAT ACCIDENTS BE NOT BUT ARABESQUES WITHIN SOME WIDER FIGURE?

AUSTIN: OF THIS, NOTHING IS KNOWN.

SOPHIE: BUT DAATH MEANS KNOWLEDGE, DOESN'T IT? HOW CAN KNOWLEDGE BE SYMBOLIZED BY A BARREN PLACE LIKE THIS?

AUSTIN: LIKE ITS SHATTERED PLANET OR ITS UNSEEN COLOR, DAATH IS THAT KNOWLEDGE KNOWABLE ONLY BY ITS ABSENCE.

AUSTIN: IT IS THE NEITHER-NEITHER. IT IS THAT KNOWLEDGE HERE PURSUED BY THE BLACK BROTHERS IN THE TOWER OF THE ADEPTS.

AUSTIN: NO LIGHT IS HERE EMITTED.

AUSTIN: FARE YOU WELL, SISTERS.

BARBARA: HUH.

BARBARA: WELL, IF HE WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT RUNNING INTO AN OLD ONE-NIGHT STAND, HE ONLY HAD TO SAY.

SOPHIE: I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT PERSONALLY. THAT WASN'T THE SAME AUSTIN SPARE YOU HAD YOUR FLING WITH.

SOPHIE: THIS ONE WAS IN SOME WHOLE OTHER SPACE.

BARBARA: YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT.

SOPHIE: YEAH. TO BE HONEST, MOST OF WHAT HE SAID, I WAS LOST.

SOPHIE: I GUESS THAT'S THE ABYSS. WE'RE INTELLECTUALLY LOST, EMOTIONALLY LOST, SPIRITUALLY LOST...

BARBARA: AT LEAST WE'RE HEADED THE RIGHT WAY. THERE'S ANOTHER RUINED PATHWAY.

SOPHIE: YOU'RE RIGHT. AND ANOTHER UNREADABLE HIGHWAY MARKER.

SOPHIE: THIS MUST BE ONE OF THOSE TWO PATHS SPARE MENTIONED, THAT LED TO AND FROM DAATH BEFORE THE WHOLE SYSTEM COLLAPSED.

SOPHIE: I GUESS ONLY THESE FAINT TRACES REMAIN.

SOPHIE: "THE BEGGAR" LED FROM CHESED TO DAATH,SO THIS MUST BE THE PATH LEADING FROM DAATH UP TO THE THIRD SPHERE, BINAH.

SOPHIE: I THINK SPARE MENTIONED ITS NAME...

BARBARA: YEAH, HE DID.

BARBARA: IT'S "THE FOUNTAIN."

ON STATUE: THE FOUNTAIN

SOPHIE: WOW. I WONDER WHAT IT USED TO MEAN?

BARBARA: WATERS BREAKING.

BARBARA: WATERS BREAKING IN THE WOMB.

BARBARA: WATERS OF THE GREAT SEA, BREAKING ON THE SHORES OF BINAH, OUR BLACK MOTHER...

SOPHIE: B-BARB A-ARE YOU OKAY?

BARBARA: ...UCHH...

BARBARA: WHAT... WHAT JUST HAPPENED? WHAT DID I SAY?

BARBARA: I--I HAD THIS LUMP IN MY THROAT...

SOPHIE: Y-YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WATERS BREAKING. AND YOUR VOICE... IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

BARBARA: JESUS, I'M SCARED. IT WAS LIKE I WASN'T THERE, LIKE I WAS JUST A SPEAKING TUBE FOR SOMETHING...

BARBARA: ...A HOLLOW REED.

SOPHIE: I THINK I READ THAT THIS SPHERE CORRESPONDS TO THE THROAT CHAKRAH. THAT'S SORT OF A SPEAKING-TUBE...

BARBARA: HOLY GOD.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, I'M TELLIN' YA, I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS PLACE.

BARBARA: COME AND LOOK.

VICTOR: AH.

VICTOR: OHH...

BARBARA: IS THAT...? IT IS. IT'S THAT CROWLEY FREAK AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME HE'S A MAN.

BARBARA: IS HE DOIN' THAT OTHER GUY?

SOPHIE: UH... YEAH.

SOPHIE: I--I THINK THAT'S VICTOR NEUBERG. I THINK THIS IS THE CHORONZON WORKING.

BARBARA: THE WHAT?

SOPHIE: CROWLEY AND HIS LOVER, THE POET VICTOR NEUBERG, WENT INTO THE DESERT TO SUMMON CHORONZON, THE DEMON OF DISPERSAL...

ALEISTER: THERE. OUR WILLS ARE EXHAUSTED.

ALEISTER: STAY IN THE CIRCLE, BROTHER. I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING...

SOPHIE: I--I HEARD THAT CHORONZON INHABITS THIS ABYSS WE'RE IN. HE'S LIKE...CHAOS. HE'S CONSTANTLY TEARING HIS WHOLE UNIVERSE INTO PIECES.

VICTOR: ALEISTER, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

VICTOR: DON'T GO INSIDE THE TRIANGLE! THAT'S FOR SUMMONING CHORONZON INTO!

BARBARA: WHAT'S CROWLEY DOING?

SOPHIE: F-FOR SOME REASON, HE INSISTED ON BEING IN THE TRIANGLE. HE CALLED THE DEMON INTO HIMSELF.

SOPHIE: NEUBERG REPORTED HORRIBLE TRANSFORMATIONS AND POSSESSIONS.

SOPHIE: WHATEVER HAPPENED, IT DESTROYED THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND NEARLY DESTROYED NEUBERG.

BARBARA: BUT...THIS CHORONZON THING, IT SOUNDS £$%&IN' TERRIFYING! WHY WOULD CROWLEY CALL IT INTO HIMSELF?

BARBARA: DID HE WANT TO GET TORN TO PIECES?

SOPHIE: I--I DON'T KNOW.

SOPHIE: MAYBE HE THOUGHT BEING TORN TO PIECES WAS NECESSARY...

BARBARA: NECESSARY? WHAT, BEING REDUCED TO PRACTICALLY NOTHIN'?

BARBARA: COME ON. I WANT US TO BE OUT OF HERE BEFORE WHATEVER HE'S SUMMONIN' ACTUALLY DECIDES TO SHOW UP!

SOPHIE: OH,NO.

SOPHIE: BARB, I THINK WE'RE TOO LATE.

BARBARA: AAA! AAAAA! SOPHIE, HELP ME...

SOPHIE: I CAN'T! OH GOD, THIS WIND, IT'S TEARING ME TO...

BARBARA: SOPHEEEE!

SOPHIE: AAAA!

SOPHIE: NO. NO NO NO. I'M STILL ALIVE. I'M STILL ALIVE. I'M...

SOPHIE: ...STILL ALIVE...

CAPTION: AND FALLING.

CAPTION: EVENTUALLY... HOURS? CENTURIES?... COMES MERCIFUL UNCONSCIOUSNESS, AND...

CAPTION: NOTHING ELSE, NONE OF THE REST, WAS TRUE, SAVE THIS INTERMINABLE DROP.

BARBARA: -CUHH-

BARBARA: OH, NO. OH, NOT THIS AGAIN. SOPHIE, I'M GONNA GO MAD.

BARBARA: IS THIS IT? IS THIS WHAT WE DO FOREVER? WE JUST FALL OR SWIM, OR STUMBLE THROUGH THAT NIGHTMARE DESERT?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, I...I THINK MY FOOT, IT JUST TOUCHED BOTTOM.

BARBARA: Y-YOU'RE RIGHT.

BARBARA: DOES THIS MEAN WE MADE IT? WE GOT ACROSS THE ABYSS?

SOPHIE: I--I THINK SO. LET'S HEAD UP THIS BLACK BEACH, SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE...

SOPHIE: ...RECOGNIZE...

IN BACKGROUND: BINAH

CAPTION: NEXT: THE WINE OF HER FORNICATIONS
