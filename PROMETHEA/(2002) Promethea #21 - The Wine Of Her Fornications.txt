SOPHIE: THIS... THIS IS ALL MY PROMETHEA STUFF. PROMETHEA'S FATHER, HE SAID IT WOULD BE RETURNED TO ME IF...

SOPHIE: WAIT A MINUTE. IS THIS MY STUFF? IT LOOKS SORT OF DIFFERENT...

BARBARA: TRY IT ON. IT WON'T FIT ME. BESIDES, I ALREADY GOT ONE.

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THIS OUTFIT LOOKS TOO BIG FOR ME...OR IS THAT HOW BIG I AM WHEN I'M PROMETHEA?

BARBARA: YOU'RE PRETTY TALL.

BARBARA: WHAT ARE ALL THESE MOTHS? THEY'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

BARBARA: ARE THEY THE SACRED ANIMAL HERE OR SOMETHING?

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): NO . WE'RE THE SACRED ANIMAL HERE: WOMAN.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): BUT THEY'RE FAMILIAR FROM SOMEWHERE. THEY'RE...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): OH, WAIT, I KNOW. IT'S THE PROMETHEA MOTH. "PROMETHEA SATURNAIDES" OR SOMETHING...

BARBARA: WHAT, LIKE SATURN THE PLANET? ISN'T THAT WHAT THAT SORTA THREE-SHAPED THING OVER THE ARCH REPRESENTS?

BARBARA: AND THE WAY THIS PLACE SMELLS OF MYRRH. THAT'S WHAT WE SMELL OF, ALL US PROMETHEAS.

BARBARA: IT'S LIKE I SAID. THIS PLACE, IT KNOWS US. IT KNOWS WHO WE ARE.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): I ... I THINK WE SORT OF BELONG HERE, OR SOMETHING.

BARBARA: YEAH ...OR THAT WE SOMEHOW COME FROM HERE.

BARBARA: IT'S...IT'S ALMOST LIKE THERE'S NO NEED TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S... OH.

BARBARA: PROMETHEA.

BARBARA: YOU'RE BACK.

SOPHIE: YES.

SOPHIE: YES, I THINK I AM.

SOPHIE: COME ON. LET'S KEEP WALKING, WHILE I TRY TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS.

BARBARA: A-ARE YOU STILL SOPHIE?

SOPHIE: YES. YES, I AM.

SOPHIE: BUT THE PROMETHEA PART OF ME...I'VE BEEN WITH MY FATHER. IT WAS WONDERFUL.

SOPHIE: IT SEEMED TO GO ON FOREVER, AND HE TOLD ME SO MANY THINGS.

BARBARA: WHAT DID HE SAY?

SOPHIE: HE... HE SAID I'D BE DIFFERENT, ONCE I'D CLIMBED THE TREE.

SOPHIE: AND HE SAID I'D ALWAYS BE ABLE TO TALK WITH HIM...

SOPHIE: ...AND HE SAID WE'D MEET OUR MOTHER HERE.

BARBARA: OUR MOTHER? WHAT, YOU MEAN PROMETHEA'S MOTHER?

SOPHIE: I...I THINK SO. HE WASN'T REALLY TALKING WITH WORDS.

SOPHIE: HE SAID THAT IN BINAH, IN THIS BLACK, THIRD SPHERE, SACRED TO SATURN, HERE'S WHERE WE'D FIND HER.

SOPHIE: BINAH'S THE HIGHEST FEMALE SPHERE. THE WORD MEANS "UNDERSTANDING."

SOPHIE: HOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM DAATH, WHICH MEANS KNOWLEDGE, OR CHOKMAH, MEANING WISDOM, I'M NOT SURE. PERHAPS IT'S LIKE...

BARBARA: SOPHIE, WAIT. LOOK UP AHEAD, IN THE BLACKNESS...

JOHN: We are the Powerhouse.

JOHN: We are the benevolent adepts.

JOHN: The Illuminati.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: ...JOHN DEE. YOU'RE DR. JOHN DEE. YOU'RE...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: ...SAW YOU IN HOD, BUT YOUNGER, AND...

BARBARA: ...THESE OUR THOUGHTS? SOPHIE, WE'RE...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: ...WHAT? WAS THAT YOU OR ME? I'M CONFUSED. I'M...

JOHN: Come with me.

SOPHIE: DR. DEE, SIR? THIS IS SOPHIA.

SOPHIE: WHAT ARE YOU AND THE OTHER...ADEPTS... DOING HERE AT THE THIRD SPHERE?

JOHN: Know, child, that here is UNDERSTANDING. That was the all of what we sought, and so we crave no higher place.

JOHN: For my part, I communed with angels told of in the Book of ENOCH, Hebrew adept SACRED to this third domain.

JOHN: In this THIRD realm, form becomes possible. The number one suggests a single POINT. With TWO points, we may describe a LINE.

JOHN: With THREE points, we may enclose a space in two dimensions. We may plot a TRIANGLE.

JOHN: Seen THUS, the triangle is symbol to the element of WATER. It is here at Binah that all water, all compassion, has its origin.

JOHN: At BINAH is the cup that OVERFLOWETH

SOPHIE (?): YOU MENTIONED THE BIBLICAL BOOK OF ENOCH, AND THE ANGELS IT SPEAKS OF. DID THEY TRULY TEACH YOU THEIR LANGUAGE? THE ENOCHIAN LANGUAGE?

JOHN: Aye. It was dictated by the spirits in my scrying glass, as too were shewn the TABLES that map all EXISTENCE.

JOHN: Boards of twelve squares by thirteen, being all together one hundred and fifty six, and on each square were SYMBOLS.

JOHN: Viewed from o'erhead, each square appeareth like unto a ZIGGURAT with flattened SUMMIT, all arrayed in rows, a mighty township.

JOHN: Behold ye this, Daughters of Understanding.

JOHN: Behold the City of the PYRAMIDS.

SOPHIE (?): THE CITY OF THE PYRAMIDS. AND THERE'S SOMEBODY ON TOP OF EVERY ONE...

JOHN: They are ADEPTS. Having reached here, they will never leave.

JOHN: On one sits EDWARD KELLY. We were PARTNERS when in life.

JOHN: Upon another young Jack Parsons sits, betrothed to She who reigneth here.

JOHN: She promised if he loved Her he should burn eternally, and so he does, in endless ECSTASY.

SOPHIE (?): WHO IS SHE? WHO RULES HERE?

JOHN: More than one name has She; more than one NATURE.

JOHN: When men KNOW her, she is then called REVELATION, for she lewdly shews herself.

SOPHIE (?): LEWD? HOW CAN SHE BE LEWD?

JOHN: Ah, yet she is wanton when she stoops, when she displays her wetness and her mystery alike...

JOHN: When is She WHORE.

JOHN: When is She BABALON.

BABALON: Know me.

BABALON: Worship me, swollen with passion, where are the Saints grown mad upon the sweet foam of my bosom.

BABALON: Scorn me, for the end of things is as stern fire about my loins, that glisten, damp with sacrifice.

BABALON: Enter me wantonly, when am I like the dreg of Brothels. Be consumed by me.

BABALON: Burn in me.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: OH, NO! OH GOD, WHAT'S SHE SAYING?

BARBARA: SHE'S US, SOPHIE, SHE'S US!

BABALON: About the markets of the World I am sent bare, until the worst of creatures may lie down with me.

BABALON: Though wretched and with sores, they shall not be refused.

BABALON: The Mead of many Rapes is sanctified in me, and is made Holy as the Stars, for I am Understanding.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: I DON'T WANNA KNOW! I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: IT'S RAINING. IT'S RAINING LIGHT, IN MY HEAD! AAA!

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: AAAA!

BABALON: Whereby they that drink the Filth of my Adulteries shall be made Clean...

BABALON: For that which fouls me is the Joy of Paradise. The Seed of Wisdom runneth from my Womb.

BABALON: See! I am couched with Beasts, that monsters of the primitive and formless Chaos shall know me.

BABALON: I am She no earthly Man nor Woman may embrace, that yet is Whore to ALL.

BABALON: Have I not fallen in thy sight? Hast thou not spat upon my Name?

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: I...WHEN I UNDERSTOOD SEX ...AND THEN, WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT MY PARENTS...

SOPHIE: I--I WALKED IN. I WALKED IN ON TRISH AND HER BOYFRIEND SCREWING, A-AND I THOUGHT...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: OH GOD.

BABALON: Hast thou not hated me?

BABALON: Hast thou not called me Harlot, that endures thy Father's infinite desires, and plundered every moment from Her birth?

BABALON: Then know Me.

BABALON: In my nakedness I am called Revelation.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: AW, GOD. OH, HOLY MOTHER...

BABALON: In the calculation of the Hebrews shall my Name be numbered Six, and Fifty, and One Hundred.

BABALON: Then am I the World's Destruction.

BABALON: Then am I that Understanding wherein all things are concluded.

BABALON: Am I BABALON.

BABALON: Yet in my Morning I am sweet, and touched by None. My breath is kindness, and my milk a solace of Angels.

SOPHIE: B-BARBARA?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, LOOK. SHE'S CHANGING.

BARBARA: YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE'S...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: NO. NO, SHE ISN'T CHANGING EXACTLY. WHAT IS THAT?

JOHN: She changes not. 'Tis but thine eye alone is changed, with comprehension.

BABALON: Then am I the World's Ease, and my breast its Comfort.

MARIE: Whence the Greeks shall calculate my Name according to their Numbering as Six, and Fifty, and One Hundred.

MARIE: Then am I the font of Pity without end.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: OH...

MARIE: Am I MARIE.

MARIE: Girded with clouds and covered with the firmament am I made Queen of Heaven.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: THE WHORE. THE WHORE AND THE MADONNA. THEY'RE BOTH...

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: TH-THEY'RE...

MARIE: In my Compassion, have I not stooped Low, so that my aspect is cast down?

MARIE: Behold, I am the Shekinah. I am the Bride, and on the World's streets ragged go I, and reviled.

MARIE: In me there is descended the Sophia, that is Wisdom's female face.

SOPHIE: SOPHIA? B-BUT THAT'S MY...NO. NO, IT HAS TO BE JUST A COINCIDENCE...

BARBARA: NO, SOPH. IT'S YOU. IT'S YOU SHE'S TALKING TO.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): That Understanding is poured out like unto blood from me.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Like noble wine, Mine essence runneth down into the Earth, and therein is degraded and made bitter.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Yet it giveth succor unto all things.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Mother am I, that sways the great dark cradle of the Night.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I ISIS, am I HECATE, am I SELENE. Black am I, like to the hidden Moon, or as a Womb.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): I taketh in, and I receive.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Virgin am I to they that know me not, and Whore am I to they that know me.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I Scarlet, and made fertile that my Passion is a great annihilating Fire that None may look upon.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I BABALON.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And further yet am I sunk down, into the World itself.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I MARY, that conceals Her child from Herod. Am I ISIS, that conceals Her child from Set.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And further yet am I degraded.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I the Scarlet Woman, Mistress to the Beast, called Crowley.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Leah Hirsig, prostituted in the Paris streets, my star gouged in her breast.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Thus does the Mother go a harlot in the World.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And this is the Vision of Sorrow.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Yet is that Understanding by another means decanted also.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): As a fiery mead of Spirit does it flow, that is not in its downward path corrupted.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Fire of Heaven is this Nectar, that not in Earth be soiled, nor quenched.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): A burning Moonfoam, then shall this True Blood, this Sangreal, be carried down upon a mighty Chariot.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): In its red Vintage is distilled the moment of my dreadful Understanding, unexpressed, that cometh privately, in dark and silence.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): That is called APOCALYPSE.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then in ignited my Affection, and made hot.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Then am I STRENGTH, that straddles Lions, and drunken on the juice of Mine own flames.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Am I the Concubine of Revelation, known and mounted with her Beast, whose number is a Man.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Revealed to Man, then is my Inspiration come unto the Earth a child.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And is that child become a tale that strikes Fire in the heart.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And is that Fire become a blaze, where in thy time, Man's World must be CONSUMED.

SOPHIE (?): I-IN THY NAME? TH-THEN YOU'RE THE PROMETHEA WHO OVERSEES THE WORLD'S END.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): Named for the moth of Saturn, where am I exalted, is she called PROMETHEA.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): From Understanding spilled as Wisdom is she called SOPHIA.

MARIE (VOICEOVER): And this is the Vision of Compassion.

MARIE: Pass on, Daughters of Understanding, robed in Mercy, Strong in Judgment.

MARIE: Harmony art thou, and Victory. From Splendour is thy radiance in the Foundation, whence shall the Kingdom be enflamed.

MARIE: Pass on, from Comprehension to that which be Understood. From Silence to the Word that comes before.

MARIE: Pass from the Womb of Forming unto that which be Inchoate. Pass from Water unto Fire.

MARIE: Unto the HIGHEST.

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: I...I ALMOST GET IT, Y'KNOW?

SOPHIE OR BARBARA: IT...IT'S LIKE, WITH UNDERSTANDING YOU GET SORROW. AND WITH SORROW YOU GET COMPASSION.

JOHN: Aye. And you, sweet spirits, are her tears, that water all the Earth, and make it fruitful.

SOPHIE: I--I'M STILL TRYING TO TAKE THIS IN, THIS...THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

SOPHIE: IT'S AS IF...WHAT I AM, WHAT I HAVE TO DO. IT'S AS IF IT WAS ALL SET OUT EVEN BEFORE MY MOM NAMED ME.

JOHN: Before thou wert CONCEIVED, child. Is it not most fearsome, and most marvellous?

JOHN: Like you, I was afraid when first the Angels told the dreadful things that I should do.

JOHN: And yet I did them.

SOPHIE: BUT...TO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M GOING TO PRESIDE OVER THE END OF EVERYTHING...

JOHN: Nay, not everything, but only that tawdry and low theatre that is called the World of Man.

JOHN: Now must ye hasten on towards thy destinies, whate'er they be. The path of DALETH, that is like a door, awaits thee.

BARBARA: AND THAT'S THE PATH THAT LEADS TO SPHERE TWO, RIGHT? MAYBE THAT'S WHERE I'LL FIND STEVE.

JOHN: Mayhap, but it is here that I must take my leave of thee upon the Fourteenth highway, where abides the EMPRESS.

JOHN: Fare you well, good wives. Say nothing as thou take thy leave of SILENCE.

BARBARA: HEY.

BARBARA: HEY, WE'RE TALKING AGAIN.

BARBARA: OUT LOUD.

SOPHIE: YES.

SOPHIE: BARBARA, I FEEL SO DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE IN EVERY NEW PLACE, I'M A NEW PERSON.

SOPHIE: WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOUR HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL DIDN'T RETURN AFTER THE ABYSS, LIKE YOU WERE PROMISED.

BARBARA: HEH. THE £$%& SHE DIDN'T.

SOPHIE: BOO-BOO?

BARBARA: YEAH. I JUST HAD TO REMEMBER MYSELF, IS ALL.

BARBARA: INSIDE, I WAS ALWAYS THIS £$%&IN' GORGEOUS.MY ASS WAS ALWAYS THIS GREAT. AND I NEVER CARED A £$%& FOR NOTHIN' BUT DOIN' RIGHT.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, THIS PATH IS £$%&IN' BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

BARBARA: DIDN'T DEE SAY THIS PATH WAS THE EMPRESS? HOW COME WE DON'T SEE HER?

SOPHIE: I THINK THIS GREENERY IS HER. MOTHER NATURE,THAT'S THE EMPRESS. ENDLESS FERTILITY.

SOPHIE: IT'S THIS PATH THAT FIRST CONNECTS THE HIGHEST FEMALE FORCE WITH THE MALE, FERTILIZING HER.

ON SIGN: 14

BARBARA: ON A FIRST DATE?

BARBARA: BOY.

BARBARA: SHE REALLY IS A BIG WHORE.
