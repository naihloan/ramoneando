KENNETH: SOMETHING'S COMING.

ON VEHICLE: LACE MOVERS

ON SIGN: SIN

HEADING: PROMETHEA

ROGER: WHO IN HELL IS THAT?

BOB: I--I DON'T KNOW.

BOB: SHE LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF SCIENCE HEROINE. MAYBE SHE'S FROM OUT OF TOWN...

KENNETH: UH...HAVEN'T I... THAT IS, DIDN'T WE MEET YOU SOMEWHERE ALREADY?

PROMETHEA: I DOUBT IT. PLEASE EXCUSE ME, BUT I'M HERE TO VISIT A SICK FRIEND.

ROGER: HMMPH.

ROGER: WELL, REALLY.

DOCTOR (?): UH, EXCUSE ME, MISS? WERE YOU LOOKING FOR...?

DOCTOR (?): ...UH...

HARRY: WHAT IN HELL...?

HARRY: LISTEN, YOU BETTER BACK OFF! I GOT ORDERS THIS PATIENT GETS NO VISITORS...

DOCTOR (?): HARRY, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I WAS HERE WHEN THIS LADY BROUGHT THE PATIENT IN EARLIER.

DOCTOR (?): JUST LET HER THROUGH, OKAY?

ON WALL: -LOO-  -4

BARBARA: HI.

ON POD: I15

PROMETHEA: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? CAN YOU TALK?

BARBARA: YEAH. YEAH, I'M OKAY. THEY'RE FIXIN' ME UP WITH THAT CLONEMEAT STUFF.

BARBARA: HUH. Y'KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, SEEIN' YOU BEIN' PROMETHEA INSTEAD OF ME.

PROMETHEA: I'M NOT FINDING IT VERY FUNNY.

PROMETHEA: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVERT TO SOPHIE, AND THESE TWO THINGS THE GOETIA ATTACKED ME, AND NOW MY FRIEND STACIA'S GONE, AND...

BARBARA: WHOAH. DID YOU SAY GOETIA?

PROMETHEA: YES. THEIR NAMES WERE ANDRAS AND MARCHOSIAS. THEY SAID THAT GOETIA MEANT "HOWLING."

BARBARA: DEAR GOD. SOMEONE MUST BE REAL PISSED AT YOU, GIRL.

BARBARA: HOW'D YOU BANISH 'EM?

BARBARA: LEMME GUESS...YOU USED THE PENTAGRAM, RIGHT?

PROMETHEA: THE FIVE-POINTED STAR? Y-YES. I JUST SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS NEEDED.

BARBARA: PROMETHEA KNEW. YOU'LL FIND HER AND SOPHIE'S PERSONALITIES FLICKERING BACK AND FORTH AT FIRST.

BARBARA: JUST TRY NOT TO GO NUTS, OKAY?

PROMETHEA: YES, BUT HOW DO I STOP BEING PROMETHEA? AND WHAT ABOUT SOPHIE'S FRIEND STACIA? SHE JUST GOT SUCKED INTO NOWHERE...

BARBARA: WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT'S THIS? YOU'RE SAYING SOME... CIVILIAN...GOT INVOLVED?

BARBARA: WHERE'S THIS FIGHT HAPPEN?

PROMETHEA: AT A ROCK CONCERT.

PROMETHEA: THE DEMONS OPENED THIS GATEWAY TO ESCAPE THROUGH. STACIA...SOPHIE'S FRIEND... WAS SUCKED THROUGH AFTER THEM.

BARBARA: OH JEEZ. LISTEN, THIS IS VERY BAD. YOUR FRIEND...SOPHIE'S FRIEND...IS IN THE IMMATERIA.

ON SAUCER: POLICE

ON BILLBOARD: Weeping gorilla COMIX  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY FIRED ME!

BARBARA: SHE'S IN MISTY MAGIC LAND.

PROMETHEA: BUT THAT'S WHERE I...WHERE PROMETHEA COMES FROM. HOW DO I GET BACK THERE? DO I OPEN A GATEWAY LIKE THOSE DEMONS DID?

BARBARA: NO. NO, THAT'S PHYSICAL MAGIC. IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF BRUTAL AND UNNECESSARY. YOU OUGHTTA BE ABLE TO DO IT IN YOUR MIND.

BARBARA: THAT'S HOW YOU GET BACK TO BEING SOPHIE, TOO. WRITING STUFF DOWN MAKES IT MORE FOCUSSED, BUT THE IMAGINATION'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

PROMETHEA: SO, WHAT, I JUST IMAGINE THIS IMMATERIA PLACE AND IT SPRINGS UP AROUND ME?

BARBARA: SURE. IMAGINATION IS PART OF THE IMMATERIA. IT'S JUST THE PART CLOSEST TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

BARBARA: ALL US VESSELS OF PROMETHEA HAVE HAD DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING THERE. MARGARET CASE USED TO YELL "MISTY MAGIC LAND, ARISE!"

BARBARA: GRACE BRANNAGH HAD A PAINTING OF THE LOST LAND OF HY BRASIL THAT SHE SORT OF PROJECTED HERSELF INTO.

PROMETHEA: UH...SO IF I WERE TO KIND OF IMAGINE, SAY, THESE COLUMNS GROWING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR, JUST AS AN EXAMPLE...?

BARBARA: THE ONES WITH SNAKES AND STARS ON TOP? YEAH, YOU'RE GETTING IT.

BARBARA: NOW, THE TRICK IS, YOU GOTTA BELIEVE IN THE COLUMNS MORE'N YOU BELIEVE IN THIS HOSPITAL. IMAGINE THEM MORE SOLID, AND THIS WORLD MORE GHOSTLY...

PROMETHEA: BARBARA? BARBARA, YOU'RE FADING AWAY...

BARBARA: GOOD. YOU ARE, TOO. THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

BARBARA: SEE, AS PROMETHEA, YOU'RE MADE OF IMAGINATION. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN MAKE THIS JOURNEY BODILY. YOU ARE WHERE YOU THINK YOU ARE.

BARBARA: NOW SOPHIE, SHE'S FLESH AND BLOOD. SHE COULD ONLY VISIT THE IMMATERIA IN HER MIND.

PROMETHEA: BUT I...I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE. I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

PROMETHEA: CAN'T YOU STAY WITH ME, BARBARA?

BARBARA: SORRY, KIDDO, BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. I CAN'T BE WITH YOU.

PROMETHEA: BARBARA?

PROMETHEA: BARBARA, WHERE AM I? I'M...

PROMETHEA: OH.

PROMETHEA: OH, MY SOUL.

HEADING: Misty Magicland

PROMETHEA: OH GOD. OH GOD, I KNOW THIS PLACE. I...

PROMETHEA: WE.

PROMETHEA: WE KNOW THIS PLACE.

PROMETHEA: IT'S...IT'S LIKE A RECURRING DREAM THAT I...THAT SOPHIE HAD WHEN SHE WAS, LIKE, NINE OR SOMETHING.

PROMETHEA: OR...OR MAYBE SHE JUST DREAMED SHE HAD THAT DREAM. OR SHE DREAMED IT ONCE, BUT IN THE DREAM SHE REMEMBERED DREAMING IT BEFORE...

PROMETHEA: OR...

RED RIDING HOOD (OFF PANEL): HEY! HEY, YOU!

RED RIDING HOOD: YOU WERE LOSIN' IT BACK THERE.

ON PACKET: MARLOE

PROMETHEA: B-BUT...I MEAN, YOU'RE EXACTLY THE WAY I IMAGINED YOU.

RED RIDING HOOD: WELL, DUH!

RED RIDING HOOD: LISTEN, YOU'RE HERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHIN', RIGHT? SO, DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU, OR YOU JUST WANNA STAND ROUND HERE ALL DAY?

PROMETHEA: I--I SUPPOSE I'M HERE LOOKING FOR A FRIEND OF MINE. SHE GOT SUCKED INTO THIS PLACE BY ACCIDENT.

RED RIDING HOOD: UH-HUH. SO IT'S LIKE THIS PERILOUS QUEST THING, YEAH?

RED RIDING HOOD: THEN YOU'LL BE WANTING THE DARK WOODS, RIGHT OVER THERE. I'M GOING THAT WAY MYSELF.

PROMETHEA: YES. YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. THEY'RE BIGGER, TOO.

PROMETHEA: WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO MEET ME.

RED RIDING HOOD: BECAUSE YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT ME, DUMMY. YOU EVEN SORTA MENTIONED ME...

PROMETHEA: BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU OR MENTIONED YOU IN...OH.

PROMETHEA: OH WAIT. YES I DID. I TOLD STACIA I WAS STUCKIN A FAIRYTALE AND WANTED TO GET OUT...

RED RIDING HOOD: "...BEFORE THE PART WITH THE WOLF." YEAH, WELL...

RED RIDING HOOD: ...SO MUCH FOR THAT, HUH?

PROMETHEA: OH GOD! OH GOD, LOOK AT IT! I'M...I'M FRIGHTENED. WH-WHY AM I SO FRIGHTENED?

RED RIDING HOOD: BECAUSE YOU'RE FACING THE UNVARNISHED IDEA, WITHOUT ANY ADULT DEFENSES LIKE DISTANCE OR IRONY OR WHATEVER. YOU'RE SEEING IT LIKE A CHILD SEES IT.

RED RIDING HOOD: PLUS IT'S A £$%&ING BIG WOLF. WHAT'S NOT TO BE FRIGHTENED OF?

WOLF: LITTLE PIGS, LITTLE PIGS, LET ME COME IN!

RED RIDING HOOD: NOT BY THE £$%&ING HAIR ON YOUR CHINNY £$%ING CHIN-CHIN, YOU £$%&ER!
