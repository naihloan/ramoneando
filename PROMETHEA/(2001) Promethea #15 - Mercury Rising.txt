PROMETHEA: ELASTAGEL, YOU SAY?

PROMETHEA: HMM. SORRY, DARLING. I CAN'T HAVE HEARD THAT PART.

PROMETHEA: OH, LOOK AT HIM, SLITHERING ROUND IN SLICES, THE SILLY MAN.

PROMETHEA (OFF PANEL): LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT HIM, SHALL WE?

CAPTION: hOD:

BARBARA: HUMH. WELL, HERE WE ARE.

BARBARA: WHERE ARE WE?

SOPHIE: THIS IS WHERE THE SUN PATH FROM THE LUNAR KINGDOM TERMINATES.

SOPHIE: WE'RE IN THE MERCURIAL REALM OF LANGUAGE, MAGIC AND INTELLECT. ITS HEBREW NAME IS HOD.

SOPHIE: THAT MEANS SPLENDOUR.

BARBARA: WHY SPLENDOUR, SPECIFICALLY?

ON TIME: SPLENDOUR

SOPHIE: WELL, I SUPPOSE COMMUNICATION IS HOW MINDS REVEAL THEMSELVES. LANGUAGE GIVES A SHAPE TO THE SPLENDOURS OF THE INTELLECT.

SOPHIE: HEY, BARBARA, DO YOU FEEL...I DON'T KNOW. SORT OF... PEPPIER? IT'S LIKE, SMARTER, BUT KIND OF MORE PLAYFUL, TOO.

BARBARA: YEAH. MY THOUGHTS FEEL ALL, LIKE, FIZZY OR SOMETHING.

BARBARA: THAT LOOKS LIKE THE STATION EXIT, OVER THERE.

ON TILES: VIII

SOPHIE: HMM. YOU KNOW, ALL THESE DECORATIONS, THEY'RE EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS AND THINGS.

SOPHIE: I GUESS THAT TELLING STORIES WITH PICTURES IS THE FIRST KIND OF WRITTEN LANGUAGE.

BARBARA: HEH. PROBABLY THAT'S WHY PROMETHEA'S MOSTLY APPEARED IN COMIC BOOKS THIS LAST CENTURY.

BARBARA: GODS USED TO BE IN TAPESTRIES, BUT NOW THEY'RE IN STRIPS.

SOPHIE: HA HA HA! BARBARA, THAT'S A REALLY CLEVER PLAY OF MEANINGS.

SOPHIE: Y'KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT: LANGUAGE, IT SHAPES OUR WHOLE CONSCIOUSNESS, HOW WE PUT IDEAS TOGETHER.

SOPHIE: EVEN OUR CONCEPTS OF TIME. BEFORE WE HAD COMMAND OF LANGUAGE, WE COULDN'T RECORD EVENTS IN THE PAST...

BARBARA: YEAH, WELL, AN ELOQUENT NEVER FORGETS.

SOPHIE: HA HA! RIGHT. AND ELEPHANTS MAKE TRUNK CALLS, WHICH RETURNS US TO COMMUNICATIONS!

SOPHIE: JEEZ. BARBARA, WHERE ARE ALL THESE PUNS AND WORD CONNECTIONS COMING FROM? MY HEAD'S SORT OF RACING...

BARBARA: MINE TOO. IT'S...

BARBARA: OH, WOW.

SOPHIE: MMM. WOW.

SOPHIE: THAT MUST BE ONE OF THOSE NEURAL PATHWAYS YOU HEAR ABOUT.

BARBARA: YEAH. AND I GUESS THOSE ARE LOGIC GATES.

BARBARA: THIS ATMOSPHERE, IT'S ALL TINGLY AND EXCITING. WHAT'S THAT KIND OF METALLIC SCENT?

SOPHIE: I THINK IT'S A PERFUME CALLED STORAX. IT'S RELATED TO THIS SEPHIROTH...

ON PILLAR: 8

BARBARA: SEPHIROTH. THAT MEANS NUMBER, RIGHT?

BARBARA: SO THIS SYMBOL MEANS THIS IS, LIKE, SEPHIROTH EIGHT?

SOPHIE: UM...YES, BUT THIS IS COMBINED WITH THE PLANETARY SYMBOL OF MERCURY.

SOPHIE: FUNNY HOW THE TWO SHAPES ARE SO SIMILAR. COINCIDENCE, I GUESS.

BARBARA: SO, ARE THESE FLOWERS SIGNIFICANT?

SOPHIE: THIS MUST BE MOLY, A FLOWER THAT HERMES GAVE ODYSSEUS AS HELP AGAINST CIRCE'S MAGIC.

SOPHIE: IT'S ACTUALLY THE MANDRAKE PLANT. SEE THE ROOT?

SOPHIE: IT'S CONSIDERED HOLY.

BARBARA: "HOLY MOLY?"

SOPHIE: THE VERY SAME.

SOPHIE: AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, THAT'S THE MAGIC SQUARE OF EIGHT.

BARBARA: I KNEW THAT.

BARBARA: IT'S AN 8x8 GRID WITH ALL THE ROWS AND COLUMNS ADDING TO...LET'S SEE...

BARBARA: TWO HUNNERD SIXTY.

ON GROUND: 61  6-

SOPHIE: UH-HUH.

SOPHIE: IT'S FROM THE MAGIC SQUARE OF EIGHT, SACRED TO MERCURY, THAT WE EVOLVED CHESS...

SOPHIE: ...OR "MANDRAKE PLAY," ACCORDING TO THOMAS HYDE'S 1694 CHESS HISTORY.

SOPHIE: GOD. H-HOW DID I KNOW THAT?

BARBARA: I DON'T KNOW. FRANKLY, I'M GETTING, LIKE, REAL HEAVY DÉJÀ VU ABOUT THIS PATH. HAVEN'T WE COME OVER THIS RISE BEFORE?

SOPHIE: AND DOWN THIS SLOPE? YES. YES, I THINK WE HAVE. AND THERE'S THAT WEIRD SOUND, LIKE PEOPLE TALKING DOWN BENEATH OUR FEET...

BARBARA: YEAH. Y'KNOW, SOPHIE, ALL THIS MATH AND LANGUAGE AND REASON...

BARBARA: ...WHY DO I FEEL THAT SOMETHING BEHIND IT THAT'S SO INTRICATE, SO INSANE?

SOPHIE: I GUESS IT'S WHERE GENIUS SHADES INTO MADNESS. SAY, IS IT GETTING DARKER AHEAD?

BARBARA: YOU'RE RIGHT. ALL THE STARS ARE OUT. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PATH, HOW IT TWISTS FROM NIGHT TO DAY.

SOPHIE: YEAH, IT'S AS IF THE PATH SNAKES THROUGH TIME AS WELL AS SPACE. SEE? IT GETS BRIGHTER DOWN THIS SLOPE...

SOPHIE: ...OR IS THAT UP THIS SLOPE? EITHER WAY, IT'S DAY AGAIN. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT: THIS PATH'S CERTAINLY PECULIAR.

BARBARA: NOT JUST PECULIAR, OKAY? INSANE! I MEAN...

BARBARA: ...JUST LOOK ON THAT BRIDGE UP AHEAD! THAT'S US, SOPHIE! THAT'S US FIVE MINUTES AGO!

BARBARA: THIS PATH'S SOME SORT OF TIME-LOOP.

BARBARA: IT HAS TO BE!

SOPHIE: GOD, BARBARA, YOU'RE RIGHT! THAT'S US, WALKING ON THE BRIDGE'S UNDERSIDE. THIS MUST BE A MÖBIUS STRIP!

BARBARA: THERE IT IS AGAIN! DÉJÀ VU! YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT MÖBIUS STRIP THING BEFORE, I'M SURE. HOW DOES IT WORK, AGAIN?

SOPHIE: IT'S A LOOP WITH A TWIST, LIKE A FIGURE EIGHT. SAY, AM I IMAGINING THINGS, OR IS IT GETTING DARKER UP THAT SLOPE AHEAD?

BARBARA: YEAH. THE STARS ARE OUT, AND I STILL HEAR VOICES BENEATH OUR FEET SAYING THE SAME THING, AND... SOPHIE, LOOK THERE! WE'RE AHEAD OF OURSELVES!

SOPHIE: SO WE ARE. YOU WERE RIGHT. IT IS SOME SORT OF TIME-LOOP.

BARBARA: DAMN RIGHT IT IS! WE'RE EVEN BACK THERE BEHIND OURSELVES. I MEAN, A LOOP IN SPACE I CAN UNDERSTAND...

BARBARA: ...BUT A LOOP THROUGH TIME, THAT'S LIKE INFINITY! THAT MEANS IT GOES ON FOREVER!

SOPHIE: MMM. WELL, I GUESS THE MÖBIUS STRIP IS LIKE THE INFINITY SYMBOL OR THE FIGURE EIGHT.

BARBARA: THERE! HEAR THAT? THE VOICES BENEATH US SAID "MÖBIUS STRIP" RIGHT WHEN YOU DID, BEFORE YOU MENTIONED THE INFINITY SYMBOL.

SOPHIE: Y-YEAH. I HEARD THEM. AND NOW IT'S GETTING BRIGHTER UP AHEAD AGAIN.

SOPHIE: Y'KNOW, BARBARA, INFINITY'S A SCARY IDEA. I MEAN, HOW DO WE GET OFF THIS THING?

BARBARA: ...GETTING, LIKE, REALLY HEAVY DÉJÀ VU ABOUT THIS PATH.

BARBARA: HAVEN'T WE COME OVER THIS RISE BEFORE?

BARBARA: WHUHH...?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, OFF THE PATH! WE HAVE TO GET OFF THE PATH NOW!

SOPHIE: AND DOWN THIS SLOPE? YES. YES, I THINK WE HAVE...

BARBARA: WOHHH. WOH, JEEZ. I FEEL NAUSEOUS. H-HOW MANY TIMES DID WE GO ROUND THAT DAMN THING?

BARBARA: ONCE? A MILLION TIMES?

SOPHIE: I-I'M NOT SURE.

SOPHIE: COME ON. WE'D BETTER FIND SOME SAFER ROUTE.

BARBARA: SURE. ASSUMING THERE IS ONE.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW THAT EXPRESSION, "STRAIGHT EIGHT?" THAT'S GOTTA BE SARCASTIC. THIS PLACE IS ANYTHIN' BUT STRAIGHT!

SOPHIE: WELL, IT'S "STRAIGHT" IN THE SENSE OF TRUTHFUL. THIS SPHERE'S ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS. TRUTH IS ITS SPECIFIC VIRTUE.

SOPHIE: C'MON. LET'S TAKE THIS BRIDGE...

BARBARA: WILL IT HOLD US? THIS SILVERY METAL...IT FLOWS AND CHANGES LIKE LIQUID. WHAT IS IT?

SOPHIE: I--I DON'T KNOW. I'M SUDDENLY GETTING THE NOTION THAT IT'S WHAT THOUGHTS AND IDEAS ARE MADE FROM. IT'S LIKE, IDEOPLASM OR SOMETHING.

SOPHIE: WE BETTER KEEP MOVING.

BARBARA: UH...YEAH, I GUESS SO. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE BRIDGE BEHIND US AIN'T THERE ANYMORE!

SOPHIE: SEE? IT IS LIKE SOME SORT OF THOUGHT-STUFF: THE WAY IT SHIFTS AND CHANGES SHAPE; MELTS AWAY TO NOTHING.

SOPHIE: IT SEEMS TO LEAD TOWARDS THAT CITADEL AHEAD.

BARBARA: UH-HUH. WHICH IS ALL MADE FROM THE SAME LIQUID FILIGREE GOOP, THIS "IDEOPLASM" OR WHATEVER.

BARBARA: THE INTRICACY... IT'S LIKE I SAID. WHATEVER LIVES HERE HAS TO BE INSANE, DON'T YOU THINK?

BARBARA: SOPHIE?

SOPHIE: ...

HERMES: WELL, WELL. THE PROMETHEA IDEA. I HAD YOU IN... WHAT? THE FIFTH CENTURY?

HERMES: I MUST SAY, YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR TIME GETTING HERE.

HERMES: ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST ENJOYING A ROUND OF MANDRAKE PLAY WITH THE BOYS. WON'T YOU JOIN US?

BARBARA: EEEYAAA!

SOPHIE: EEEYAAA!

HERMES: THERE. NOW, I THINK INTRODUCTIONS ARE IN ORDER... THOUGH THERE'S SELDOM ORDER IN INTRODUCTIONS.

HERMES: YOU KNOW THOTH OF COURSE, THOUGH NOT IN HIS NON-SYNCRETIC FORM. THE NOISY BEAST WITH HIM IS HIS APE, THE CYNOCEPHALUS.

HERMES: THE GENTLEMAN ON THE EIGHT-LEGGED HORSE IS THE NORSE MAGIC-GOD WOTAN, WHILE THIS MISCHEIVOUS LITTLE CHAP IS THE BOY MERCURY.

THOTH: I APOLOGIZE FOR MY CYNOCEPHALUS. HE AND THE TRICKSTER HANUMAN CURRENTLY HAVE A DISAGREEMENT. I EXPECT IT'S MONKEY BUSINESS.

BARBARA: GODS. REAL GODS. OH SOPHIE, THEY'RE SO...THEY'RE SO SWEET. I--I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA CRY OR SOMETHING...

SOPHIE: I KNOW. I-IT'S LIKE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN MANKIND'S VERY BEST...FRIENDS, I GUESS.

SOPHIE: OLD FRIENDS.

HERMES (OFF PANEL): HERE...

HERMES (OFF PANEL): ...COME ON UP. OUR PLAY'S AT AN INTERESTING STAGE. YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.

HERMES (OFF PANEL): SO, WHAT FINALLY BRINGS YOU TO HOD? CALL ME THRICE-GREAT HERMES WHEN YOU ANSWER, BY THE WAY.

BARBARA: IS HE SERIOUS?

SOPHIE: SHHH!

SOPHIE: UH...TH-THRICE GREAT HERMES, MY FRIEND BARBARA SEARCHES FOR HER DEPARTED HUSBAND, STEVEN SHELLEY.

SOPHIE: HE WAS BOTH WRITER AND OCCULTIST. WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT FIND HIM HERE.

BARBARA: HEY! EVERYTHING'S MADE FROM THAT QUICKSILVER STUFF...

THOTH: NATURALLY. HOD'S WHERE ALL THE FORM SEEN IN THE LOWER SPHERES OF DREAM AND MATTER HAS ITS ORIGINS.

THOTH: ALL PERCEIVABLE FORM IS MADE FROM THIS QUICKSILVER STUFF. WE CALL IT LANGUAGE.

BARBARA: HEY, THIS IS WRONG...

BARBARA: I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY ONE KNIGHT LEFT IN PLAY. HOW COME THE GAME'S CONTINUING? IT'S  IMPOSSIBLE.

HERMES: AH, WELL. THAT'S WHERE BEING OMNIPOTENT COMES IN USEFUL.

HERMES: DEAR ME. JUST LOOK AT THAT POOR LITTLE KNIGHT...

HERMES: ...HE'S BEEN GOING AROUND THE BOARD ALL ALONE, TRYING NOT TO LAND ON THE SAME SQUARE TWICE.

HERMES: YOU CAN SEE THE ORDER OF HIS MOVES.

ON BOARD: 4-  9  6  61  2-  12  45

BARBARA: GHAA! SOPHIE, WE'RE BACK ON THAT MAGIC SQUARE THING!

SOPHIE: Y-YEAH...

SOPHIE: ...BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT MAGIC SQUARE. THE NUMBERS ARE IN A DIFFERENT ORDER.

BARBARA: AWW, GOD! SOPHIE, WE'RE OUTSIDE AGAIN! IF WE ARRIVE BACK ON THAT MÖBIUS THING, I'LL SCREAM!

HERMES (OFF PANEL): OH DEAR. NOBODY WANTS THAT.

HERMES: MUCH BETTER IF WE CONTINUE WITH OUR STROLL.

HERMES: MAY I, LADIES?

SOPHIE: WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE. WE WEREN'T HAVING A STROLL! WE WERE ON THIS CHESSBOARD IN A CHAMBER, WITH YOU AND SOME OTHER GODS!

HERMES: WERE WE? WELL, THAT DOESN'T MATTER HERE. IT'S ALL A STORY, ISN'T IT? IT'S ALL FICTION, ALL LANGUAGE...

HERMES: IT CAN CHANGE LIKE QUICKSILVER.

SOPHIE: BUT...THIS ISN'T FICTION. THIS IS OUR REAL LIFE.

HERMES: HA HA! REAL LIFE. NOW THERE'S A FICTION FOR YOU!

HERMES: WHAT'S IT MADE FROM? MEMORIES? IMPRESSIONS? A SEQUENCE OF PICTURES, A SCATTERING OF HALF-RECALLED WORDS...

HERMES: DISJOINTED HIEROGLYPHIC COMIC STRIPS, UNWINDING IN OUR RECOLLECTION...

HERMES: LANGUAGE.

HERMES: TO PERCEIVE FORM... EVEN THE FORM OR SHAPE OF YOUR OWN LIVES...YOU MUST DRESS IT IN LANGUAGE.

HERMES: LANGUAGE IS THE STUFF OF FORM.

HERMES: MATHEMATICS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A LANGUAGE. CONSIDER THE FORMS IT PRODUCES...

HERMES: THIS MAGIC SQUARE OF EIGHT IS CALLED THE KNIGHT'S TOUR.

HERMES: CONNECT ITS NUMBERS IN SEQUENCE, AND YOU PRODUCE THE MAGIC LINE OF EIGHT.

ON BOARD: 1(?)  2(?)  49  2  6  22  -3  (?)  9  60  5  (?)  11  4(?)  61  24  (?)2  62  21  (?)2  45  4  51  19  36  25  40  (?)  44  5(?)  30  26  39  20  33  56  29  14  43  35  8  37  2(?)  41  16  (?)  38  27  34  (?)

HERMES: DO YOU SEE? MATHEMATICS IS A LANGUAGE, A HUMAN INVENTION, A FICTION... AND YET IT CREATES SUCH ELEGANT FORM.

HERMES: IT CREATES SPLENDOR.

HERMES: IT CREATES TRUTH.

BARBARA: SO...EVERYTHING'S MADE FROM LANGUAGE? WE'RE MADE OF LANGUAGE? EVEN YOU?

HERMES: OH, EXPECIALLY ME! HOW COULD HUMANS PERCEIVE GODS...ABSTRACT ESSENCES...WITHOUT CLOTHING THEM IN IMAGERY, STORIES, PICTURES...

HERMES: ...OR PICTURE-STORIES, FOR THAT MATTER.

SOPHIE: PICTURE-STORIES?

HERMES: OH, YOU KNOW: HIEROGLYPHICS. VASE PAINTINGS. WHATEVER DID YOU THINK I MEANT?

HERMES: BESIDES, WHAT COULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE THAN FOR A LANGUAGE-GOD TO MANIFEST THROUGH THE ORIGINAL PICTOGRAPHIC FORM OF LANGUAGE?

SOPHIE: UHH...SO LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

HERMES: WHAT AM I SAYING?

HERMES: I'M SAYING SOME FICTIONS MIGHT HAVE A REAL GOD HIDING BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE PAGE.

HERMES: I'M SAYING SOME FICTIONS MIGHT BE ALIVE...

HERMES: ...THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

SOPHIE: UHH...WHO WERE YOU LOOKING AT? THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND US...

HERMES: OH, I HAVE MY JESTS. PLEASE PAY THEM NO ATTENTION.

HERMES: NOW, LET US HEAD OVER HERE, SHALL WE?

HERMES: THERE'S PEOPLE I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

JOHN: OUR GAME IS PAUSED, MY FELLOWS. ONE CALLED THREE-TIMES-GREAT APPROACHES, IN A COMPANY OF MAIDENS.

AUSTIN: HUH. WELL, CROWLEY, I MUST SAY, I DON'T FANCY YOURS MUCH.

ALEISTER: WHY, SPLENDID! KNOWING YOUR TASTES, I IMAGINE "MINE" WOULD BE THE YOUNGER OF THESE DIVINELY-ESCORTED LADIES?

JOHN: THRICE-NOBLE ONE! HOW MAY WE SERVE THEE?

HERMES: DOCTOR, THIS FAIR LADY SEEKS HER HUSBAND, BOTH A SCRIBE AND SORCEROR. HAS HE PASSED THIS WAY, I WONDER?

BARBARA: UM, HIS NAME'S SHELLEY. STEVEN SHELLEY.

AUSTIN: HMM. YANK, WASN'T HE? WROTE CARTOON STRIPS. I THINK I REMEMBER HIM PASSING THROUGH HERE. HE WENT ON, THOUGH.

SOPHIE: WAIT A SECOND...CROWLEY. YOU'RE ALEISTER CROWLEY!

ALEISTER: HA HA. WHY, YES.

ALEISTER: I KNOW.

SOPHIE: I--I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I LOVE YOUR WORK. THE THOTH DECK, IT'S JUST...INCREDIBLE.

ALEISTER: WHY, THANK YOU. I WONDER, WOULD IT DISTRESS YOU GREATLY IF I KISSED YOUR BEHIND?

AUSTIN: IGNORE THEM. I'M AUSTIN.

SOPHIE: W-WOULD...*?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, COME ON. WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE. YOU HEARD THE GUY SAY STEVE HAD GONE ON.

BARBARA: YEAH, BUT AUSTIN HERE'S SEEN HIM!

BARBARA: COULDN'T HE SHOW US WHERE STEVE WENT?

HERMES: A SPLENDID IDEA. MR. SPARE HERE CAN GUIDE YOU OUT OF HOD...

HERMES: ...ALTHOUGH I HOPE YOU'LL VISIT AGAIN SOON. PROMETHEA IS ONE OF MY FONDEST CREATIONS, YOU KNOW.

SOPHIE: UH, WHICH WAY DO WE GO?

HERMES: THAT WAY.

HERMES: TRAVEL WELL, WOMEN. THE SPHERE OF THE MAGICIANS WISHES YOU A SAFE PASSAGE.

ON SIGN: ROUTE 27

BARBARA: HUH! LIKE ANYBODY'S PASSAGE IS SAFE WITH THAT BALD CREEP AROUND.

AUSTIN: OH, THAT'S JUST CROWLEY'S WAY. SOMETIMES EVEN I CAN'T STAND THE CHAP. HE DOES A LOT OF IT TO IRRITATE DEE, OF COURSE.

SOPHIE: THAT OLD ENGLISH GUY! THAT WAS DOCTOR JOHN DEE, RIGHT? I'VE SEEN ENGRAVINGS.

SOPHIE: AND YOUR NAME SOUNDED FAMILIAR, MR...?

AUSTIN: I'M AUSTIN SPARE... OR AT LEAST I'M THE PART OF HIM THAT'S IN THIS REALM.

AUSTIN: I WAS A BLOODY GOOD ARTIST. BETTER MAGICIAN, MIND YOU.

SOPHIE: I'VE HEARD OF YOU. JACK... MY MAGICIAN FRIEND...SAID I SHOULDN'T TRY UNDERSTANDING YOUR WORK UNTIL I KNEW MORE.

BARBARA: HEY, WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE?

BARBARA: I MEAN, THOSE PEOPLE ARE FALLING. SHOULDN'T WE HELP THEM?

AUSTIN: THERE'S NO POINT, BARBARA, MY LOVELY. THEY'RE ALWAYS FALLING. THAT'S THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER. IT'S THE SYMBOL OF THIS 27th PATH.

AUSTIN: IT'S EVERY TOWER MAN OR WOMAN EVER BUILT...A BUILDING, A MARRIAGE, A CAREER... THAT WAS MEANT TO REACH HEAVEN.

AUSTIN: THE LIGHTNING IS WHAT TEACHES US HUMILITY.

AUSTIN: FOR ME, IT WAS WHEN JERRY BOMBED MY BRIXTON STUDIO DURING THE BLITZ.

AUSTIN: HELL OF A £$%&ING MESS! LEFT ME PARALYZED DOWN MY RIGHT SIDE. COULDN'T BLOODY DRAW, COULD I?

SOPHIE: WHAT DID YOU DO?

AUSTIN: WELL, M'DARLING, WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID?

AUSTIN: HALF PARALYZED OR NOT, I WAS STILL THE BEST BLOODY MAGICIAN IN LONDON, AND BUGGER CROWLEY IF HE SAYS OTHERWISE.

AUSTIN: NO, ON SECOND THOUGHTS DON'T, JUST TO SPITE HIM.

AUSTIN: ANYWAY, I TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO DRAW PERFECTLY USING MY LEFT HAND, AT WHICH POINT MY RIGHT SIDE RECOVERED COMPLETELY.

BARBARA: WOW. THAT'S AMAZING. I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE SOME OF YOUR WORK.

AUSTIN: I'D LIKE TO SHOW IT TO YOU... AND WHERE BETTER THAN HERE ON THE PATH BETWEEN MERCURY AND VENUS, BETWEEN EIGHT AND SEVEN...

AUSTIN: BETWEEN INTELLECT...AND PASSION?

AUSTIN: PERHAPS YOUR YOUNG FRIEND COULD RUN ON AHEAD? DOESN'T SHE HAVE SOMEWHERE SHE SHOULD BE?
