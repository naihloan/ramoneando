DOCTOR (?) (OFF PANEL): I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WHY IS HER BODY REJECTING THE GRAFTED CLONE TISSUE? IT SHOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS HER OWN.

DOCTOR (?) (OFF PANEL): I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HER ANTIBIOTICS TO CHECK THE REJECTION PROCESS...

DOCTOR (?): THAT'S GOING TO BOOST THE RISK OF INFECTION...

DOCTOR (?): WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. IF HER BODY CONTINUES TO REJECT ITSELF, MRS. SHELLEY IS DEAD.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): HMMPH.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): WELL, I GOTTA SAY, THIS DON'T LOOK TOO FRIGGIN' GOOD.

DOCTOR (?): BUT...LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, THERE WAS THAT FUNNY BLACK INFECTION IN THE WOUND WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT IN...

BARBARA: IN FACT, THIS LOOKS FRIGGIN' AWFUL. I WONDER WHAT THE GIRLS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?

DOCTOR (?): YES, BUT THE INFECTION VANISHED. I MEAN, IT DIDN'T CLEAR UP, IT JUST...I DON'T KNOW. EVAPORATED OR SOMETHING.

DOCTOR (?): LIKE IT WAS NEVER THERE...

BARBARA: MAYBE I OUGHTTA GO ASK 'EM. I HAVEN'T BEEN ACROSS TO VISIT IN A WHILE...

ON BOOK: A FAERIE ROMANC-  THE LIFE AND  -RKS OF CHARLTON SENNET

?: MARGIE, DARLING, MUCH AS WE ALL LOVE YOU, IF YOU DON'T KEEP QUIET, I SHALL DISINTEGRATE YOU.

?: OH, LOOK, ANNA. IT'S YOUR STORY THE NEW GIRL'S INTERESTED IN.

ANNA: AYE. AYE, SO IT SEEMS.

ANNA: I-I CANNOT SAY I LIKE IT WHEN MY TALE IS READ. THE PAIN OF IT IS ALL TOO FRESH.

ANNA: MY BABY, AND HOW SHE WAS TOOK FROM ME.

ANNA: AND HIM. I LOVED HIM, SISTERS, THAT I DID.

ANNA: I LOVED HIM.

ON BOOK: Chapter One  Charlton Sennet was twenty eight years old when he took his adoring wife Emily and moved with her to a woodside cabin on the outskirts of Boston in the April of 1779. Sennet, the son of a New Hampshire mill owner, had married Emily two years before, when he'd been twenty six and she a girl of barely twenty. Sennet, at that time was a young man without profession who subsisted on a generous allowance from his wealthy father. Though it seems he had discussed the possibility of taking up some  (?) pursuit upon occasions in the  was not until the Spring that  and his wife settled in their arborea-

CAPTION: I am alone. I stare into the table's woodgrain and dare not look up. I say the words once more. I am alone.

CAPTION: My wife has gone, my Emily.

CAPTION: So too has Anna gone, my mistress, and with her my muse, likewise departed.  I shall say it yet again:

CAPTION: I am alone.

CAPTION: Today is New Year, first day of a bright new century I fear I am not long for.

CAPTION: More than twenty years ago,we came here when this place seemed full of hope.

CAPTION: Hope and Inspiration...

ANNA: MASTER CHARLTON?

ANNA: MISTRESS EMILY SAYS I'M TO CALL YOU FOR YOUR SUPPER, BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR, FOR INTERRUPTING.

CHARLTON (OFF PANEL): OH, DON'T WORRY, ANNA. YOU'VE NOT INTERRUPTED ANYTHING OF CONSEQUENCE.

CHARLTON (OFF PANEL): I'M FIFTY STANZAS INTO THIS CONFOUNDED PIECE, AND NOTHING INTERESTING HAS HAPPENED.

ANNA: OH, DO NOT SAY SUCH THINGS, SIR! WHAT YOU READ TO ME ABOUT THE SHEPHERD BOY FAIR TUGGED MY HEART.

CHARLTON: WHY, BLESS YOU. SADLY, I'M HAVING RATHER MORE DIFFICULTY IMAGINING THE FAIRIES MY POEM'S SUPPOSEDLY ABOUT.

EMILY: AH, CHARLTON. THERE YOU ARE!

EMILY: LOOK WHAT A FEAST I'VE MADE FOR US!

EMILY: YOU'RE SURELY HUNGRY AFTER YOUR HARD WORK?

ANNA: I-I'LL GO AND SEE THE GRAVY DOESN'T BURN...

CHARLTON: EMILY, IT MAY NOT LOOK AS IF I'M DOING MUCH, BUT WRITING IS HARD WORK.

EMILY: I'M CERTAIN THAT IT IS...

EMILY: ...BUT SURELY ONE AS PRACTICED AS YOURSELF MIGHT DO IT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED?

EMILY: IN FACT, NOW I THINK OF IT, I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN SEEN YOU WORK THAT WAY.

EMILY: ANNA, DEAR, WOULD YOU PASS THE GRAVY?

CAPTION: "Then to that diamond-beaded glade there came  A pageant throng of sweet imaginings,

CAPTION: "Of Fairies, imps and creatures without name,

CAPTION: "A great, frenetic bustling of wings.

CAPTION: "About their Queen, four nymphs in waiting stood,  Girded in armor, each of beauty rare,  "Cowslip, and Flax and Jenny-in-the-Wood...

CAPTION: "...and sweet Promethea, With her plaited hair."

ANNA: GOOD DAY TO YOU, MASTER CHARLTON.

CHARLTON: *UHWHAA...?

CHARLTON: A-ANNA?

CAPTION: June 7th, 1779:

ANNA: WELL, MASTER CHARLTON, WITH MISS EMILY AWAY TO SEE HER PARENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THIS NEXT WEEK, PERHAPS YOU'LL GET SOME WORK DONE.

CHARLTON: ACTUALLY, ANNA, I'VE ALREADY MADE GREAT PROGRESS... AND IT'S THANKS TO YOU.

ANNA: T-TO ME? WHY, SIR, WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

CHARLTON: WELL, I'VE PARTLY BASED THE LEADING FAERIE UPON YOU, AFTER THIS SORT OF DAYDREAM THAT I HAD.

CHARLTON: HERE, IF YOU LIKE, I'LL READ SOME TO YOU.

CHARLTON: "PROMETHEA, THE SHEPHERD UNDERSTOOD, HAD WITH HER GLAMOURS CAPTIVATED HIM; WITH LIPS, WITH SKIN LIKE POLISHED BETEL-WOOD, WITH OCEAN EYES, WHEREIN A MAN MIGHT SWIM.

CHARLTON: "HER SMILE ETHEREAL, MAGNIFICENT, HER LYRIC MOVEMENTS, HER FRAGILITY...

CHARLTON: "HER GENTLENESS, HER ORCHIDACEOUS SCENT ENRAPTURED HIM, ENSLAVED HIM UTTERLY.

CHARLTON: "PHANTASMAGORIA, MADE SOMEHOW REAL, YET DELICATE, PERHAPS TO DISAPPEAR AT HIS IMPETUOUS TOUCH, HIS NEED TO FEEL HER SUMMER-JASMINE BREATH CLOSE TO HIS EAR."

PROMETHEA (OFF PANEL): CHARLTON...

PROMETHEA: MORE WORDS...

PROMETHEA: WORDS

PROMETHEA: BRING ME

PROMETHEA: THROUGH.

CAPTION: "Unchained, the poet-shepherd's tongue took flight.  Such verse and poesy from his lips there poured..."

CHARLTON: A-ANNA?

CHARLTON: I-IS IT YOU?

CAPTION: "As might lend substance to this sylph of light,  Or goad the very Heavens to applaud."

PROMETHEA: NO.

CAPTION: "She, raised in realms of Fancy,had ne'er known  Another's flesh, nor that warm, mortal thrill  Of passion. How they loved! Each sigh and moan  Would halt the world, or bid all time stand still."

CAPTION: "Each kiss endured while mountains wore to dust.  Whole lives passed 'twixt each measured bedboard creak,  So lost were they in their transcendant lust  That they knew not the hour, nor day...

CAPTION: "...nor week.

CAPTION: "Embracing Heaven, Earth slips through our hands.  Wordly affairs fragment, and fall away...

CAPTION: "We reached that place which no man understands,  Where reason falters, and blind love holds sway."

ANNA: M-MASTER CHARLTON? WAS IT EVER...AAAA!

ANNA: W-WAS IT EVER ME YOU LOVED? J-JUST FOR A LITTLE... AAOOW...A LITTLE WHILE?

CHARLTON: H-HUSH, ANNA. THE BABY...

ANNA: THE BABY, THE BABY'S WRONG. Y-YOU CAN'T... AAOH...YOU CAN'T... MAKE CHILDREN...WITH A STORY. DID YOU...

ANNA: DID YOU LOVE ME?

CHARLTON: A-ANNA...

ANNA: DID YOU...AAAAAA!

ANNA: NNAAAAAAAH!

CHARLTON: ANNA, IT'S COMING. OH DEAR LORD, THE BABY, IT'S...

CHARLTON: OH GOD. ANNA... THE BABY, IT'S...

CHARLTON: I-IT'S NOT A BABY! IT'S ONLY HALF REAL, ANNA! IT'S...

CHARLTON: ANNA?

CAPTION: I only made one grave, which some found queer, but there was only Anna to be buried.

CAPTION: After all, we did not have a child. Rather we had the dream of one...

CAPTION: ...and that dream, why, it vanished. Melted quite away.

CAPTION: Save for these wretched, ill-kept journals, I have written not a word since then. My muse. My muse is gone.

CAPTION: I see the faeries only when I drink now, which is all the time. My love is not amongst them.

CAPTION: It was not Anna that I loved. It was the fantasy I'd spun about her.

CAPTION: Now that fantasy had fled, I sometimes doubt it ever truly happened, and was not instead some dream of mine.

CAPTION: But things are ever thus with faeries...

CAPTION: ...and romance.

CAPTION: I am alone.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): SOPHIE.

SOPHIE: HUH?

SOPHIE: UHH...

SOPHIE: HOW...HOW DID IT GET SO DARK? WHERE DID EVERYBODY...?

FAUST: "HOW DID IT GET SO DARK?"

SOPHIE: WHO...?

FAUST: " WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?"

SOPHIE: AAAA!

FAUST: EITHER PHRASE WOULD WORK NICELY ON A TOMBSTONE, WOULDN'T IT?

SOPHIE: WAIT A MINUTE... WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? WHO ARE YOU?

FAUST (SINGS) (OFF PANEL): DID YOU EVER SEE A DREAM WALKING?

FAUST (SINGS) (OFF PANEL): WELL, I DID...

FAUST (SINGS): DID YOU EVER HEAR A DREAM TALKING?

FAUST (SINGS): WELL, I DID.

FAUST: YOU'RE SOPHIE. BANGS, ISN'T IT? YOU'RE THE NEW BEAUTEOUS CUTIEOUS WITH A CADUCEUS UP YOUR GLUTEUS.

FAUST: I'M JACK FAUST.

SOPHIE: I--I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I...WAIT A MINUTE. I HEARD OF YOU.

SOPHIE: BAR...UH, A FRIEND OF MINE. I THINK SHE MENTIONED YOU.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): FAT BABS? COMPLIMENTARY, I HOPE?

FAUST (OFF PANEL): SHE'S GOING TO DIE, YOU KNOW. IN THREE DAYS TIME.

SOPHIE: L-LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?

SOPHIE: A-AND I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK I AM, BUT THIS IS CREEPY AND I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

FAUST: OH SOPHIE...

FAUST: SOPHIE, SOPHIE, BO BOPHIE. BANANA-FANA-FO FOPHIE. ME, MI, MO MOPHIE. SOPHIE...

FAUST (OFF PANEL): ...LET'S CUT THE CRAP.

PROMETHEA: YOU'VE REVEALED ME. CLEARLY, YOU HAVE MUCH ART.

PROMETHEA: I THINK I KNOW YOU FROM BEFORE. YOU ARE THE MAGICIAN. THE SNAKE-HANDLER. THE JUGGLER.

PROMETHEA: YOU INTRODUCED YOURSELF TO ME WHEN I WAS BILL, AND THEN WHEN I WAS BARBARA...

SOPHIE: ...UNNHHH...

FAUST: YES. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE AT THIS STAGE, WHEN YOU'VE NOT YET CLEARLY DEFINED WHO YOU ARE.

FAUST: I THOUGHT I'D COME AND INTRODUCE MYSELF TO THE NEW GIRL BEFORE SHE'S HAD TIME TO BECOME PREJUDICED AGAINST ME.

PROMETHEA: YOU MEAN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D SEE HOW BIG A THREAT SOPHIE POSES BEFORE SHE'S EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO SPOT YOU COMING.

PROMETHEA: I TAKE IT THAT YOUTHFUL APPEARANCE IS MERELY A GLAMOUR YOU MOLDED FOR THE OCCASION?

SOPHIE: NNNGH...

FAUST (OFF PANEL): OH, ALLOW AN OLD MAN HIS VANITIES. AFTER ALL, SHE IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): AND I'M JACK. JACK THE FAUST. I LIKE TO LOOK MY BEST. I LIKE TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES.

PROMETHEA: WERE YOU HOPING TO SEDUCE HER?

FAUST: OH, PLEASE! GIVE ME SOME CREDIT. I HAVE SUCCUBI FOR THAT!

FAUST: TO BE HONEST, I JUST WANTED TO SEE HER BEFORE SHE ENDS UP INSANE OR GUTTED ON AN ALTAR SOMEWHERE.

FAUST: I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW HOW MANY ENEMIES ARE GUNNING FOR HER, DON'T YOU?

FAUST: THERE'S A MAGICIAN CALLED BENNY SOLOMON. I HEAR HE'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK SPECIALLY TO SEE YOU. YOU OUGHT TO WATCH OUT FOR HIM.

FAUST: HE SENT THOSE DEMONS...

PROMETHEA: YES. SO THEY TOLD ME. HE WORKS FOR THE TEMPLE.

FAUST: ONLY ON A FREELANCE BASIS. THE TEMPLE WOULD NEVER ADMIT TO EMPLOYING A MAGICIAN. IT'S AGAINST THEIR RELIGION.

FAUST: STILL, THEY WANT YOU DEAD. THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO END THE WORLD.

PROMETHEA: WHY WOULD THEY THINK THAT?

FAUST: OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS AMNESIAC INBETWEEN STATE. I ALMOST FORGET HOW MUCH I HATE YOU THE REST OF THE TIME.

FAUST: THEY THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO END THE WORLD, DUMMY.

PROMETHEA: BUT... THAT'S NOT TRUE!

FAUST: YOU REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING, CAN YOU? NOW, PERSONALLY, I THINK ENDING THE WORLD'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA! ANY REAL MAGICIAN WOULD AGREE.

FAUST: PROMETHEA'S FATHER CERTAINLY DID WHEN HE UNLEASHED HIS DYING CURSE UPON HUMANITY.

FAUST: THAT'S YOU, INCIDENTALLY.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): AH.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): THAT'S BETTER.

FAUST (OFF PANEL): I SEE I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION.

BARBARA: JACK FAUST! GODDAMN! THIS IS SCREWED.

BARBARA: BILL, YOU OR ME SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED HIM EARLIER, THE AMOUNT OF TROUBLE HE GAVE US!

BILL: WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME! YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF, HE WAS USING A GLAMOUR! I'VE NEVER HAD ANY RESISTANCE TO GLAMOURS!

GRACE: DON'T KEEP US IN SUSPENSE, DARLINGS! WHO IS HE?

BARBARA: JACK'S A MAGICIAN... OR AT LEAST, HE IS THESE DAYS.

BARBARA: HE'S MANIPULATING SOPHIE, MISDIRECTING HER. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ENDING THE WORLD...

MARGIE: OH! HE IS BAD. YES!

MARGARET: BE QUIET, MARGIE. GRACE, THIS IS SERIOUS. TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT UNBALANCE HER...

GRACE: YES. YES, IT MIGHT, RATHER. AND AN INSANE PROMETHEA IS TOO DREADFUL TO CONTEMPLATE.

GRACE: DO YOU KNOW, I ABSOLUTELY HATE MAGICIANS.

MARGARET: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? HE'S SNARED HER AT HER MOST VULNERABLE.

ANNA: SISTERS, LOOK HERE! A NEW IMAGE IS FORMING...

MARGIE: UM. SHE HAS DONUTS. I AM HUNGRY FOR SURE!
