GRACE: INCIDENTALLY, AREN'T THESE ROOMS NICE?

STACIA: UH, YEAH, KINDA. ARE THESE THE ROOMS YOU HAD BACK IN THE TWENTIES OR WHENEVER?

GRACE: MORE A FANCIFUL MEMORY, REALLY. IT'S THE APARTMENT I COULDN'T AFFORD.

GRACE: REGARDING THOSE DEMONS: ALL WE DID WAS ACCEPT THEM AS PARTS OF US, YOU KNOW.

STACIA: Y-YOU KNOW, I'M, UH, I-I'M SORTA WORRIED ABOUT SOPHIE . TH-THAT VISION WE SAW...

SOPHIE: GOD, THIS BLUE. I FEEL RICH JUST LOOKING AT IT. I FEEL LIKE...I DON'T KNOW. LIKE I'VE ARRIVED.

ON ARCH: CHES-  -D

BARBARA: YEAH. OR THAT I'VE COME HOME OR SOMETHING. BUT IT'S ALL CLOUDY AND VAPOROUS...

BOO-BOO: YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT, THE HIGHER YOU CLIMB THE TREE. THERE AIN'T MUCH £$%&IN' FORM ONCE YOU GET UP PAST HOD.

BOO-BOO: IT'S LIKE, THE FURTHER UP YOU GO, THE LESS THERE IS TO SEE, AND THE MORE THERE IS TO FEEL AND UNDERSTAND.

SOPHIE: I CAN'T IMAGINE MUCH THAT'S HIGHER THAN THIS. THIS IS THE FOURTH SPHERE, RIGHT?

SOPHIE: "CHESED," THERE ON THE ARCH ABOVE THE JUPITER SYMBOL. I THINK IT MEANS MERCY.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, I JUST WORKED OUT WHY THIS PLACE FEELS LIKE HOME.

BARBARA: IT'S THAT SMELL, LIKE WHEN MY DAD WAS PLANING WOOD...

BOO-BOO: THAT'S THE CEDAR INCENSE THEY BURN HERE. PLUS, Y'KNOW, THIS IS A KINDA FATHERLY-TYPE PLACE.

SOPHIE: YOU'RE RIGHT. DESPITE EVERYTHING BEING MADE FROM CLOUD, IT ALL FEELS SOLID AND REASSURING, LIKE IT WOULD PROTECT YOU.

BARBARA: SURE. IT'S LIKE A DAD, ONLY IT'S DADDY WARBUCKS. SOMEBODY RICH AND SUCCESSFUL...

BOO-BOO: YEAH, IT'S PRETTY £$%&IN' PATRICIAN ALL RIGHT. AN' BEIN' THE FOURTH SPHERE, YOU CAN BET IT'S FOUR-SQUARE £$%&IN' SOLID, TOO.

BOO-BOO: SEE, FOUR, THAT'S LIKE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS YOU NEED TO DEFINE A SOLID THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECT, SAY A PYRAMID.

BOO-BOO: WHEN THE ENERGY OF GOD POURS DOWN INTO BEING, THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE IT TRULY MATERIALIZES.

BOO-BOO: WE'RE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE £$%&IN' UNIVERSE, WHERE EVERYTHING'S BORN INTO EXISTENCE, AND IT'S THIS PLACE THAT NURTURES AND PROTECTS IT.

BOO-BOO: THIS IS THE SHELTERING SKY.

SOPHIE: SO I SUPPOSE THIS SPHERE IS WHERE ALL THE SKY-GODS AND ALL-FATHERS ARE REPRESENTED. ZEUS, THOR, JUPITER, INDRA AND SO ON...

BARBARA: I FEEL SORT OF... REASSURED. LIKE I'M SAFE WITH GROWNUPS OR SOMETHING. IT'S THIS SAPPHIRE LIGHT...

BOO-BOO: YEAH. S'LIKE THIS £$%&IN' MALLARME POEM I REMEMBER: "THE AZURE! THE AZURE! THE AZURE!"

BOO-BOO: COME ON. FOLLOW ME.

SOPHIE: WHAT ARE THESE BEADS? THEY'RE SO POLISHED I CAN SEE EVERY DETAIL OF MY REFLECTION.

BOO-BOO: THIS IS INDRA'S NET.

BOO-BOO: SEE, INDRA, HE'S THE HINDU SKY-GOD, OKAY? AND HIS NET, IT'S THIS INFINITE MESH OF GLEAMING BEADS...

BOO-BOO: AND IN EVERY SINGLE BEAD, ALL THE OTHER BEADS ARE REFLECTED, ALONG WITH THE REFLECTIONS THAT ARE IN THEM, GOING ON FOREVER.

BOO-BOO: SO, LIKE, EVERY PART COMPLETELY AND PERFECTLY REFLECTS THE WHOLE.

BOO-BOO: THAT'S INDRA'S NET...

BOO-BOO: ...OR REALITY, AS THEY CALL IT WHERE YOU COME FROM.

BOO-BOO: I HEAR IF YOU BREAK UP ONE OF THEM HOLOGRAM THINGS, EVERY PIECE STILL HAS THE WHOLE IMAGE IN IT. OR IT'S LIKE WITH THE KABALLAH...

BOO-BOO: THE TREE OF LIFE, YEAH, SURE, THAT'S A MAP OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. IT'S ALSO A MAP OF WHAT'S INSIDE EACH OF US.

BOO-BOO: "AS ABOVE, SO BELOW," SEE? ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT £$%&IN' LEVELS, EXISTENCE REFLECTS ITSELF.

SOPHIE: AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS...THEY'RE ALL SOMEHOW LEVELS OF OURSELVES, RIGHT? DEMONS, ANGELS, GODS...

BARBARA: YEAH. YOU SAID DEMONS WERE A PART OF US, AND, LIKE, YOU'RE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL, SO YOU'RE A PART OF ME...

BOO-BOO: SURE. DEMONS ARE JUST YOUR LOWEST DRIVES, GETTING OUT OF HAND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE WORKIN' FOR YA. US ANGELS, WE'RE YOUR HIGHEST DRIVES.

BOO-BOO: AS FOR THE DEITIES, MAYBE THEY'RE PART OF YOU, MAYBE YOU'RE A FALLEN PART OF THEM, BUT IT DON'T MATTER. EVERYTHING'S PART OF GOD.

SOPHIE: SO EXISTENCE IS ALL ONE THING? EVERYTHING IN IT, WE'RE ALL PART OF SOME BIG...I DON'T KNOW. SOME VAST FLOCK? SOME IMMENSE ORGANISM?

BARBARA: I LIKE THAT. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M... INCLUDED. LIKE EVERYONE'S INCLUDED.

BOO-BOO: YEAH. AND LOVED. AND FORGIVEN.

BOO-BOO: THIS IS BIGGER THAN THE LOVE PEOPLE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER.

BOO-BOO: THIS IS THE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OF THE UNIVERSE FOR ITS CHILDREN. FOR ITSELF.

BOO-BOO: AN' HERE, IN THIS RICH BLUE, WEALTHY WIT' STARS, HERE'S WHERE YOU FEEL IT. WHERE YOU KNOW IT.

BOO-BOO: THAT MERCY. THAT VISION OF LOVE. Y'KNOW, THIS £$%&IN' UNIVERSE, IT REALLY TRIES ITS £$%&IN' HARDEST FOR US.

BARBARA: M-MY DAD, HE WORKED ON A FARM. HE SAID, SURE, SOMETIMES ANIMALS DIED, BUT THE FARMERS HAD CARED. THEY'D TRIED THEIR BEST, Y'KNOW?

SOPHIE: IT'S...IT'S LIKE WE ALL HAVE TO PROTECT EVERYTHING, BECAUSE IT'S ALL PRECIOUS. IT'S ALL US.

BOO-BOO: YEAH. THAT'S CHESED. THAT'S JUPITER. YOU'RE GETTIN' THE IDEA.

BOO-BOO: EXISTENCE LOVES US. IF IT COULD, IT'D STOP A BULLET FOR US.

BOO-BOO: AN' IT WORKS £$%&IN' HARD TO PUT BREAD ON THE TABLE FOR US, AN' TO KEEP A £$%&IN' SKY OVER OUR HEADS.

BOO-BOO: AN' IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S A FATHER, AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FATHERS DO.

FATHER: AYE. THAT IS WHAT FATHERS DO.

FATHER: WELL, GIRL? HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME? I SAID THAT WE WOULD MEET EACH OTHER IN THE WESTERN LANDS.

BARBARA: HUH? WHO'S THAT? DO...DO I KNOW THAT GUY?

SOPHIE: I...I'M NOT SURE. THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT HIM, BUT...OH, GREAT GODS!

BOO-BOO: WHAT? WHO THE £$%& IS HE? HOW COME I DON'T KNOW HIM?

FATHER: BECAUSE, BRIGHT ONE, THIS IS THE MAGIC OF A MAN, AND NOT THAT OF ANGELS.

FATHER: OH, CHILD. LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

SOPHIE: I...I REMEMBER. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SENT HER... SENT ME INTO THE DESERT. YOU'RE MY...MY...

SOPHIE: OH FATHER.

SOPHIE: OH FATHER, I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

FATHER: THERE. DRY YOUR EYES. WE ARE TOGETHER AGAIN.

FATHER: WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOGETHER, MY LOVE, MY DAUGHTER. ALWAYS.

SOPHIE: HAVE WE? HAVE WE TRULY? THESE LONG, STRANGE CENTURIES THAT I HAVE LIVED THIS LIFE...I--I FELT WE WERE APART.

FATHER: ALL PARENTS MUST AT LAST SEND THEIR CHILDREN OUT INTO THE DESERT, PRAYING THAT THE GODS FIND THEM BEFORE THE WOLVES.

BARBARA: NOW I KNOW YOU! THE ORIGINAL PROMETHEA, THE LITTLE GIRL!

FATHER: BUT I WAS ALWAYS WITH YOU. MY HEART WALKED EVER AT YOUR SIDE.

BARBARA: YOU'RE HER FATHER!

FATHER: AND I KNOW YOU, BARBARA RAMIREZ WHO IS BARBARA SHELLEY. YOU ARE ONE OF THE WORTHY VESSELS THAT HAS BORNE MY TREASURE DOWN THE CENTURIES.

FATHER: AND DEAR SOPHIA BESIDE ME, SHE BEARS IT NOW. BOTH OF YOU HAVE MY LOVE, MY GRATITUDE.

FATHER: IF YOUR SOULS SHOULD SURVIVE THE TRIAL THAT WAITS AHEAD, THEN YOU SHALL LEARN MUCH OF PROMETHEA; OF MY DAUGHTER'S TRUEST NATURE.

FATHER: BUT KNOW THIS: SHE SHALL NOT BE WITH YOU IN THAT TRIAL.

SOPHIE: FATHER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I...SOPHIE... I HAVE TO BE WITH BARBARA!

FATHER: AND SO SHALL BARBARA BE WITH SOPHIA. BUT MY DAUGHTER PROMETHEA, SHE MUST ABIDE WITH ME A WHILE.

BARBARA: HUH? WHAT'S HE TALKIN' ABOUT?

BOO-BOO: SHUSH. I THINK I SEE WHERE HE'S GOIN' WITH THIS.

FATHER: AYE, ANGEL OF BARBARA RAMIREZ. YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE PAINFUL DUTY YOU YOURSELF MUST SOON NOW UNDERTAKE.

FATHER: SOPHIA, IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER UP TO ME. IF YOU SURVIVE THE WASTELANDS, YOU SHALL MEET WITH HER AGAIN.

FATHER: UNTIL THEN, WE HAVE MUCH TO SPEAK OF, SHE AND I.

SOPHIE: F-FATHER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I-I FEEL SO STRANGE...

FATHER: I AM GATHERING YOU UP, MY CHILD, AS ONCE I DID WHEN YOU WERE SMALL.

FATHER: I AM GATHERING YOU UP INTO MY ARMS.

BARBARA: SOPHIE? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

BOO-BOO: LEAVE IT, BABYDOLL. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

SOPHIE: UHHH...

FATHER: THERE. NOW ALL IS AS IT MUST BE. MY CHILD AND I ARE REUNITED, AND SOPHIA IS NOW READY FOR HER TEST.

SOPHIE: OOUGH. OUHH, GOD...

BARBARA: TEST? WHAT TEST?

BARBARA: SOPHIE, SWEETHEART, ARE YOU OKAY?

FATHER: SHE IS AS SHE WAS. SHE IS WITHOUT HER ANGEL, JUST AS YOUR OWN SHALL SURELY LEAVE YOU AT THE PRECIPICE AHEAD.

FATHER: IF YOUR LEAP BE TRUE, YOU SHALL REGAIN THESE TREASURES ON ITS FURTHEST SHORE.

FATHER: MY CHILD AND I MUST LEAVE YOU HERE. GOODBYE, KIND WOMEN. GOODBYE, AND FARE YOU WELL.

BARBARA: HEY, WAIT! I DON'T GET ANY OF THIS! COME BACK!

BOO-BOO: BARB, FORGET IT, OKAY? HE'S DOIN' WHAT HE HAS TO. IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

BOO-BOO: HOW ABOUT YOU, KID? NOT FEELIN' SO GOOD?

SOPHIE: I... JEEZ, I DUNNO. I...

SOPHIE: I FEEL LIKE I LOST SOMETHING. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY DID HE TAKE PROMETHEA AWAY?

BOO-BOO: LOOK, HE'S HER DAD. HE AIN'T SEEN HER IN SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEARS. I GUESS HE WANTS QUALITY TIME.

BOO-BOO: PLUS, THERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE PRECIPICE. THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT.

BARBARA: H-HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. HE SAID YOU'D BE LEAVING ME.

SOPHIE: UH... TH-THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE, JUST UP AHEAD.

BOO-BOO: I DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS GUY AT ALL.

SOPHIE: M-ME NEITHER.

JUAN: MAN, THIS IS LIKE CITY TRANSPORT.

JUAN: YOU GONNA WAIT FOREVER FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, THEN THREE GONNA SHOW UP AT ONCE.

BOO-BOO: OH, LISTEN TO HIM, DON'T HE TALK FINE? WHO THE £$%& ARE YOU, MAN?

BARBARA: W-WE JUMP? INTO NOTHING? THAT'S WHAT MAGICIANS DO? THAT'S WHAT STEVE DID?

BARBARA: S-SOPHIE, I HAVE TO DO THIS, TO FIND STEVE. YOU DON'T. YOU CAN TURN BACK...
