LUCILLE: I DON'T GET IT.

LUCILLE: THIS IS WHAT YOU BUREAU SCIENCE-WONKS WERE SO EAGER WE SHOULD SEE?

LUCILLE: A BLACK EGG?

HANSARD: NO, AGENT BALL. THAT'S A GLASS CONTAINER. OUR FIND IS PRESENTLY SPREAD IN A THIN FILM OVER THE INSIDE OF IT.

HANSARD: WE FOUND THE ORIGINAL FRAGMENT SQUIRMING AROUND OUTSIDE A VANDALIZED NEW YORK LOCK-UP, LAST YEAR.

HANSARD: RIGHT AFTER THAT "TROTSKY'S" INCIDENT.

LUCILLE: THAT WAS THE ROCK-CONCERT RIOT WITH AN EARLY PROMETHEA SIGHTING...

KAREN: SO HOW BIG WAS THIS LIVING FRAGMENT THING?

HANSARD: MAYBE FIVE MILLIMETERS. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S REGENERATED QUITE A LOT SINCE THEN.

HANSARD: ABOUT A MONTH AGO, IT STARTED TALKING.

HANSARD (OFF PANEL): ONLY IN MUDDLED OUTBURSTS, ADMITTEDLY, BUT IT MENTIONED THIS WOMAN YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

HANSARD (OFF PANEL): LET'S SEE IF WE CAN WAKE IT UP FOR YOU.

HANSARD: AH. THERE WE GO.

HANSARD: I SHOULD WARN YOU, IT'S MOSTLY INCOHERENT. FRANKLY, IT SEEMS BARELY ABLE TO HOLD ANY SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TOGETHER FOR LONG.

LUCILLE: UGHH. HOW IT MOVES.

LUCILLE: THAT'S HORRIBLE.

SMEE: Well?

KAREN: WHO? WHO SENT YOU TO KILL PROMETHEA?

SMEE: That... that was the TEMPLE, shirley?

ON TIE: 5

HAL (ON TV): BUT, MARV, EVEN IF THE DOLL WAS STILL ALIVE, WHY WOULD HE RETURN TO KILL THIS ONE MINOR SCIENCE-VILLAIN?

BARBARA: OH, SOPHIE. IT'S ALL SHINING. AND THE RAINBOW DEW. I FEEL LIKE JEWELS.

BARBARA: I LOVE THIS. I £$%&ING LOVE THIS. AND I LOVE YOU.

BARBARA: JUST FOR EXISTING, I LOVE YOU.

SOPHIE: OH, BARBARA. BARBARA, THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

BARBARA: YEAH. AND THIS EDEN HUMIDITY.

BARBARA: I CAN FEEL MY SOUL ON FIRE. WHITE WINGS SPREADING OUT, OPAL AT THE FEATHER-TIPS. OH.

BARBARA: OHHHH, £$%&.

SOHIE: SO THIS IS CHOKMAH. THIS IS WISDOM. OF COURSE. IT HAD TO BE LIKE THIS.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE. I WANT TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): I WANT TO BE NAKED IN THIS...THIS EXPERIENCE.

SOPHIE: MY NEW ROBES FEEL OKAY. THEY FEEL RIGHT.

SOPHIE: I'M SOMEBODY NEW HERE.

BARBARA: MMM. AND THIS PLACE IS NEW, AND FRESH, BUT IT'S BEEN HERE FOREVER.

BARBARA: JUST THIS FEELING OF...OF GENTLE, SHIMMERING...GRACE, I GUESS.

BARBARA: WHAT DID THOSE FOUR WORDS NEAR THE ARCH MEAN? "ET IN ARCADIA EGO...?"

SOPHIE: I THINK IT'S THIS FAMOUS INCOMPLETE QUOTE FROM A POUSSIN PAINTING: "AND IN ARCADIA, I..."

SOPHIE: ARCADIA WAS AN ANCIENT GREEK STATE, A COMPLETE WILDERNESS, WHERE PAN WAS SUPPOSED TO DWELL.

SOPHIE: "THE LAND BEFORE THE MOON."

SOPHIE: I GUESS IF THE THIRD, FEMALE SPHERE IS THE MOON'S HIGHEST ASPECT, THEN THIS SECOND SPHERE COMES "BEFORE THE MOON."

SOPHIE: THIS IS GOD AS MALE, THE HIGHEST MALE ELEMENT.

BARBARA: AND WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

SOPHIE: THEY MUST BE THE FOUR TAROT KNIGHTS, OR KINGS. THEY'RE ALL ATTRIBUTED TO THIS PLACE, JUST LIKE ALL THE QUEENS ARE AT BINAH.

SOPHIE: THERE'S A NAME OF GOD, IHVH, PRONOUNCED YOD-HE-VAU-HE, THAT EXPRESSES THE MEANING OF THE WHOLE TREE OF LIFE.

SOPHIE: THIS PLACE, CHOKMAH, IS REPRESENTED BY THE FIRST SYLLABLE, YOD. IT'S THE INITIAL EXPRESSION OF THE ENERGY. IT'S MALE. IT'S FIRE. IT'S WANDS. IT'S SPIRIT.

SOPHIE: THE SECOND, FEMALE SYLLABLE, HE, IS ALL THE QUEENS, AT BINAH. VAU IS THE PRINCES, AT TIPHERETH, AND THE FINAL HE IS PRINCESSES, AT MALKUTH.

SOPHIE: THE STRUCTURE OF EVERYTHING, OF BEING, IT'S JUST SO... SPLENDID.

BARBARA: YES. AND ALIVE, AND FERTILE, AND...I KEEP WANTING TO SAY SEXY, BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

BARBARA: OR IF IT IS, IT'S NOT PHYSICAL SEX. NOT HUMAN SEX. IT'S GODSEX OR SOMETHING.

SOPHIE: HAHA. GODSEX. THAT'S BRILLIANT.

BARBARA: EVERYTHING'S BRILLIANT. THIS QUIET, SACRED JOY. THE SWEET MUSK IN THE AIR, AND THAT SMELL, LIKE...

BARBARA: IS THAT HASHISH?

BARBARA: MMMM. WHICH PLANET REPRESENTS THIS PLACE?

SOPHIE: THERE'S NO PLANET. CHOKMAH IS THE ZODIAC. ALL THE STARS.

SOPHIE: ALL EXPLODING INTO BEING, LIKE SOME GLORIOUS...UTTERANCE, OR SOMETHING. AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S HAPPENING NOW. HAPPENING HERE.

SOPHIE: THIS PERFECT, TIMELESS MOMENT WHERE EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. THE BEGINNING. THE END...

BARBARA: HEY! LOOK AT THIS.

BARBARA: IT'S A PATH OF WANDS. A ROYAL ROAD...

SOPHIE: WELL, THIS PLACE IS GOD AS MALE, THE HIGHEST MALE PRINCIPLE.

SOPHIE: THE WAND IS THE PHALLUS, SO ALL WANDS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO CHOKMAH.

SOPHIE: ALL WANDS, ALL SPIRIT, ALL FIRE. THE INITIATING ENERGY.

SOPHIE: JUST LIKE BINAH IS CUPS, COMPASSION, WATER...

SOPHIE: HEY, I JUST THOUGHT: WATER'S SYMBOL IS A DOWNWARD TRIANGLE, FIRE'S IS AN UPRIGHT TRIANGLE.

SOPHIE: THE SON OF THEIR UNION IS AIR, TIPHERETH, THE STAR OF DAVID, COMBINING THE TWO.

BARBARA: I GET IT. YOU WERE RIGHT, ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF IT ALL. IT'S SO ELEGANT. IT'S SO SIMPLE AND LOVELY.

BARBARA: IT'S JUST RINGING WITH HOLINESS.

SOPHIE: I KNOW. MAGIC IS GLORIOUS. THE FEELING THESE WANDS CREATE...

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW. WISDOM. JUST WISDOM.

SOPHIE: UNDERSTANDING, THAT HAPPENS IN THE WOMBDARK SILENCE INSIDE US. WISDOM IS EXPRESSED, IT JUST SPILLS OUT, UNBIDDEN...

BARBARA: UH-HUH. SO IT'S A GUY THING.

BARBARA: KINDA LIKE THIS.

BARBARA: OHHHH! HA HA!

BARBARA: SOPHIE, YOU WERE RIGHT! THIS IS WHERE ALL THE STARS SPURT INTO BEING!

SOPHIE: BARBARA, YOU LOOK SO GOOD. THIS WILL SOUND WRONG, BUT I WISH WE'D HAD SEX WHILE YOU WERE ALIVE.

BARBARA: YEAH. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. AND I FEEL WE CAN JUST SAY THAT HERE, HONESTLY, WITHOUT ANY MISUNDERSTANDING.

BARBARA: IT ISN'T SEX, EXACTLY...

SOPHIE: I KNOW. IT'S WHISPERING AFTERWARDS. SOUL TOUCHING SOUL.

SOPHIE: OH, BARBARA.

BARBARA: I KNOW. LOVE. WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

BARBARA: OH, SOPHIE WE'RE AT THE SOURCE.

SOPHIE: YES. OF ALL EXISTENCE.

BARBARA: ALL EXISTENCE. THE MOMENT IT BEGINS. THE MOMENT IT ENDS. I LOVE YOU.

BARBARA: GODSEX. IT'S ALL GODSEX. IT'S SO PURE, AND IT'S SO DIRTY, IT'S...

BARBARA: WHAT'S THAT WORD? THE WORD THAT MEANS SACRED AND PROFANE?

SOPHIE: TABOO.

SOPHIE: PAN. PAN AND SELENE. THE MYTH, WHERE PAN RAPES HER, ALTHOUGH...IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE WANTED THAT. LIKE HE HAD TO.

SOPHIE: IT'S LIKE BABALON RIDING THE BEAST. THE CELESTIAL GODDESS AND THIS CHAOTIC ANIMAL FORCE.

SOPHIE: IT'S THE PRIMAL SCENE. IT'S MOM AND DAD DOING IT, HUMPING TOWARDS THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION, BUT IT'S THE CONCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSE.

SOPHIE: THE UNIVERSE.

SOPHIE: ALL THE MALE AND FEMALE ENERGIES POUNDING IN THE BINARY THROB OF BEING. ON AND OFF. BACK AND FORTH. IN AND OUT.

SOPHIE: GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM. THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE. THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE. EARTH, AIR, WATER, FIRE. THIS PHOSPHOROUS ANGEL COPULATION...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): BUILDING. LIKE MUSIC BUILDING TO A CRESCENDO.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): BUILDING TO ITS OUTBURST. UNNH. BUILDING TO...UNNHH... TO THAT FIRST, FORMLESS...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ...UNNHHH...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ...FIRST, FORMLESS UTTERANCE, THAT...UNNNHHH...THAT FIRST EXPRESSION...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): IN... THE BEGINNING... IS...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ...THE WORD...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ...AND THE WORD...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ...IS...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): "I"

BARBARA: HOLY £$%&.

BARBARA: I JUST CAME. EVERYTHING JUST CAME.

BARBARA: W-WAS THAT THE BIG BANG?

SOPHIE: ...Y...

SOPHIE: ...GIVE ME A SECOND...

SOPHIE: YES. THAT'S HOW IT ALL...

SOPHIE: ...CAME INTO BEING...

BARBARA: AND LOOK. IT'S STILL GOING ON.

SOPHIE: IT'S ALWAYS STILL GOING ON. SPACETIME. THE BEGINNING. THE END.

SOPHIE: ALL THE TIME. ALL AT ONCE.

SOPHIE: COME ON. LET'S WALK.

SOPHIE: I WAS JUST THINKING, ABOUT WHAT I LEARNED AT BINAH. ME, PRESIDING OVER APOCALYPSE.

SOPHIE: THIS IS IT, ISN'T IT? REVELATION. THIS HEAVENLY LIGHT.

SOPHIE: THIS IS WHAT EVERYTHING BEGINS IN. THIS IS WHAT EVERYTHING ENDS IN.

SOPHIE: THIS HUMMING PRISMATIC RADIANCE...

SOPHIE: BUT ON AN EARTHLY PLANE, I MEAN, IT'S GOING TO BE TERRIFYING.

SOPHIE: TERRIFYING.

BARBARA: YEAH. THIS... THIS ILLUMINATION. THE MOMENT WHEN THE LIGHTS GO ON.

SOPHIE: YES.

SOPHIE: BARBARA, I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S OCCURRING BACK ON EARTH. ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE I'VE BEEN GONE.

BARBARA: I KNOW. MAYBE SOMETHING'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

BARBARA: YOU THINK IT'S STARTED? THE END OF THE WORLD?

BARBARA: DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW.

SOPHIE: JUST THE WIND, I GUESS.

BARBARA: YEAH. IT MUST BE RISING.

BARBARA: ALL OF A SUDDEN I GOT ALL THESE GOOSEBUMPS.

SOPHIE: HEY, LOOK OVER THERE. THE COLORS ARE CHANGING.

SOPHIE: IT'S THE NEXT PATH. THOSE STAIRS. AND IS THAT SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEM?

ON SIGN: 11

SOPHIE: I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU'RE EVERYWHERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

ALEISTER: TALKING TO SPIRITS AND DELUSIONS, EVIDENTLY.

ALEISTER: AS FOR HERE, I'M IN MY TEMPLE AT CEFALU. IT'S 1921, AND I'M PREPARING TO BECOME THE IPSISSIMUS.

ALEISTER: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

SOPHIE: WE'RE LOOKING FOR STEVEN SHELLEY.

SOPHIE: ISN'T IPSISSIMUS THE HIGHEST MAGICAL GRADE, THAT CORRESPONDS TO KETHER?

ALEISTER: IT'S HIGHER THAN KETHER.

ALEISTER: STEVEN SHELLEY, YOU SAY?

ALEISTER: I THINK HE PASSED ME EARLIER, HEADING UP PATH ELEVEN HERE.

ALEISTER: "THE FOOL."

ALEISTER: YOU KNOW, I'M STILL NOT SURE I'M READY FOR IPSISSIMUS.

ALEISTER: I THINK I'M AFRAID. YOU SEE, FROM HERE YOU CAN LOOK UP AND BEHOLD THE VISION OF GOD, FACE TO FACE.

ALEISTER: UP AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

ALEISTER: DON'T LOOK AT IT FOR TOO LONG, OR YOU'LL NEVER LOOK AWAY.

SOPHIE: UH...

SOPHIE: B-BARBARA, THAT'S ENOUGH.

SOPHIE: DON'T LOOK AT IT ANY MORE.

BARBARA: OH GOD. OH GOD, I WAS GONE.

BARBARA: BUT...IF THAT'S WHERE STEVE WENT, THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO GO.

SOPHIE: O-OKAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T COME WITH US, MR. CROWLEY?

ALEISTER: OH, I'M ALREADY THERE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE, JUST LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SITTING UNDECIDED HERE.

ALEISTER: YOU GO AHEAD. GOOD LUCK WITH GOD.

BARBARA: OKAY. OKAY...

BARBARA: I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT DOING THIS, BUT... BUT I FEEL I HAVE TO TRUST THE IMPULSE, YOU KNOW?

SOPHIE: WELL, THAT'S WHAT THIS "FOOL" PATH IS ABOUT. IRRATIONAL LEAPS INTO THE UNKNOWN.

SOPHIE: BARBARA, I'M SCARED. LET'S HOLD HANDS AGAIN.

BARBARA: SURE.

BARBARA: WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS NEXT SPHERE YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

SOPHIE: I-IT'S THE HIGHEST SPHERE, SPHERE ONE. THE CROWN.

SOPHIE: YOU CAN BE ANNIHILATED IN IT. YOU CAN FUSE WITH IT.

BARBARA: FUSE WITH IT?

SOPHIE: YES.

SOPHIE: THE WHITE LIGHT. THE PURE, PERFECT EXPERIENCE OF GOD.

SOPHIE: SOME SOULS JUST DISSOLVE INTO IT, FOREVER. SOME SOULS GO INTO IT AND DON'T COME BACK. BUT THEN...

SOPHIE: ...WHY WOULD YOU?
