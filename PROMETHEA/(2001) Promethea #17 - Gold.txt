HEADING: GOLD

BARBARA: EVERYTHING'S SO STILL AND PEACEFUL, LIKE JUST BEFORE DAWN.

BARBARA: THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

SOPHIE: THIS IS BEAUTY.

SOPHIE: THAT'S WHAT TIPHERETH MEANS: BEAUTY. HARMONY. IT'S LIKE THE SUN. IT'S THE POINT OF BALANCE ALL THE OTHER SPHERES REVOLVE AROUND.

SOPHIE: IT ALL GOES ROUND AND ROUND.

ON ARCH: K-

SOPHIE: PLANETS ORBIT THE SUN, LIKE THE PARTS OF US THAT THEY REPRESENT ORBIT OUR CENTRAL SELF.

SOPHIE: WE'RE NOT OUR BODIES, THOUGHTS OR EMOTIONS.

SOPHIE: WE'RE THE SELF THAT HAS THOSE THINGS.

BARBARA: THEN THIS SELF'S OUR IMMORTAL PART? OUR SOUL? WHAT DIES IS BODIES, WORLDLY IDEAS, LOWER STUFF LIKE THAT?

BARBARA: SO WHERE DOES THE SOUL GO?

SOPHIE: SOME SAY WE REINCARNATE, JUMP BACK ON THE WHEEL OF KARMA...

BARBARA: IS THAT TRUE?

SOPHIE: PERHAPS. SOME BELIEVE THIS IS HEAVEN, AND THAT WE STAY HERE. AFTER ALL, IT'S THE HIGHEST HUMAN POINT IN THE KABBALISTIC SYSTEM.

SOPHIE: OTHERS BELIEVE WE MERGE INTO ONE ETERNAL SPIRIT. ONE SELF...

BARBARA: HOLD ON... HIGHEST HUMAN POINT?

SOPHIE: YEAH. THE TREE OF LIFE ARRANGEMENT'S A CIRCLE, REPRESENTING THE CELESTIAL, WITH A CROSS BENEATH IT REPRESENTING WORLDLY EXISTENCE.

SOPHIE: TIPHERETH'S MANKIND'S HIGHEST POINT, AND GOD'S LOWEST, WHERE THE TWO CONNECT.

BARBARA: THIS SPHERE'S AS LOW AS GOD DESCENDS INTO... I DUNNO. THE UNIVERSE?

SOPHIE: ABSOLUTE GOD'S THE HIGHEST SPHERE, ABOVE EXISTENCE. TIPHERETH'S GOD BORN INTO EXISTENCE, AS MAN. AS HIS OWN SON, I GUESS.

SOPHIE: HUMANITY'S HIGHEST POINT.

BARBARA: I CAN BELIEVE THAT. EVERYTHING HERE FEELS TIMELESS.

SOPHIE: I THINK IT'S ONLY OUR WORLDLY MINDS THAT ORDER EVENTS INTO SEQUENCES, INTO PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.

SOPHIE: GOD'S ETERNAL. WE'RE FEELING GOD'S TIMELESSNESS EVEN DOWN HERE.

BARBARA: AND THIS TIPHERETH PLACE IS OUR HIGHEST SELF, RIGHT?

BARBARA: I KNEW IT FELT FAMILIAR. IT FEELS LIKE ME, Y'KNOW?

BARBARA: IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. DO OUR SOULS' JOURNEYS ALWAYS RETURN TO THE SAME PLACES?

SOPHIE: YES. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OASIS THAT WE REVISIT. A CALM POINT AT THE CENTER OF THINGS, AT THE BURNING LION'S HEART OF US.

SOPHIE: WHERE WE FIND OUR WILL, OUR SOUL. WHERE WE KNOW OUR SELF.

BARBARA: "KNOW THYSELF." SO THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT ABOVE THE ARCHWAY.

BARBARA: TO REALLY KNOW THIS PLACE THAT'S IN ALL OF US. THIS...I DON'T KNOW...HOLY PLACE. IT'S LIKE A SEAM OF PURE GOLD INSIDE US.

SOPHIE: YES. THIS SPHERE'S THE GOLD THAT ALCHEMISTS SOUGHT.

SOPHIE: DISCOVERING IT IS WHAT MAGICIANS CALL THE GREAT WORK.

SOPHIE: IT'S WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN GREEK ABOVE THE ARCH OF SUN-GOD APOLLO'S ORACLE AT DELPHI: "KNOW THYSELF."

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): ON THE TREE OF LIFE, THIS SIXTH, SOLAR SPHERE IS THE SELF, THE SOUL, OUR TRUE WILL.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): TIPHERETH'S PART OF THE CELESTIAL CIRCLE. DOING OUR TRUE WILL IS DOING THE UNIVERSE'S WILL.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): EVERYTHING'S SO GOLDEN HERE...

SOPHIE: IT'S TIMELESS AND GOLDEN.

SOPHIE: TIPHERETH'S WHERE WE ENCOUNTER OUR HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL, OUR HIGHEST SELF.

SOPHIE: AND LIKE THE VISIONARY IMMANUEL SWEDENBORG SAID, "ANGELS KNOW NOTHING OF TIME." FOR OUR HIGHEST SELF, EVERY MOMENT IS ETERNAL.

SOPHIE: IT'S ALL A CIRCLE. IT'S A GOLDEN CIRCLE GOING ON FOREVER...

BARBARA: SOPHIE? WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THIS PLACE BEING HEAVEN, OR WHERE EVERYBODY MERGES INTO ONE SOUL OR WHATEVER?

BARBARA: WELL, WHAT ABOUT STEVE?

BARBARA: I MEAN, IF I FIND HIM HERE, WILL HE STILL BE STEVE? THE STEVE THAT I KNEW?

SOPHIE: WELL, YOU'D BOTH BE YOUR TRUE SELVES HERE, SO I GUESS YOU'LL BOTH BE DIFFERENT.

SOPHIE: BUT THAT'S OKAY...

SOPHIE: SEE, THIS PLACE IS BEAUTY, AND EINSTEIN SAID BEAUTY IS TRUTH.

SOPHIE: WHAT PEOPLE ARE HERE, THAT'S THE TRUTH, THE BEAUTIFUL REALITY. LIFE'S A DREAM WE WAKE FROM.

SOPHIE: HERE, WE'RE WHO WE ARE IN OUR HEARTS.

BARBARA: IT'S WEIRD. ONE MINUTE I'M FILLED WITH THIS INCREDIBLE JOY, AND THE NEXT...

BARBARA: DUNNO. SORROW, I GUESS, ALTHOUGH I CAN'T TELL WHERE IT'S COMING FROM...

SOPHIE: I KNOW. IT'S LIKE CLOUDS PASSING ACROSS THE SUN.

BARBARA: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S LIKE! I KEEP THINKING THE LIGHT'S CHANGING, BUT IT'S ME. IT'S INSIDE ME.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, HOW COME THERE'S SORROW IN HEAVEN?

SOPHIE: WELL, IF THERE WEREN'T, IT WOULDN'T BE HEAVEN. IT'D BE DISNEYLAND.

BARBARA: HEH. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

BARBARA: EVEN SO, I'D EXPECTED MORE ANGELS...

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW. I KEEP GETTING THIS FEELING LIKE... LIKE THIS BRIGHT INFORMATION? BUT IT'S SO PURE, IT ISN'T ABOUT ANYTHING?

SOPHIE: IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN...

SOPHIE: I GUESS I JUST MEAN A SENSE OF PRESENCE.

BARBARA: I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

BARBARA: THIS IS A STRANGE PLACE. IT'S SWEET AND FAMILIAR, BUT THEN IT'S LIKE BEING ON SOME MOUNTAIN-TOP INSIDE YOURSELF, IN THE WIND AND LIGHT.

BARBARA: YOU KNOW. SORT OF SCARY.

SOPHIE: YEAH. IT'S ALMOST LIKE BEING NAKED OR SOMETHING. NAKED IN YOUR BARE SOUL.

SOPHIE: IT FEELS GOOD, BUT IT FEELS VULNERABLE, LIKE...

SOPHIE: OH JEEZ.

SOPHIE: BARBARA, LOOK THERE...

BARBARA: IT'S A LITTLE KID. WHAT'S SHE DOIN' HERE?

BARBARA: Y-YOU KNOW, SHE'S SORT OF FAMILIAR...

SOPHIE: SHHH. DON'T SCARE HER AWAY...

BOO-BOO: WHAT, YOU THINK I CAN'T HEAR YA? STOMPIN' THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE A COUPLE O' £$%&IN' ELEPHANTS, MAN.

BOO-BOO: HEY, BARB? GOTTA SAY, YOU BREAK ME UP IN THAT HAT. WHAT IS THAT, GIRL?

BARBARA: HUH? YOU KNOW ME?

BOO-BOO: HA! WELL, I KNOW IT'S GOTTA BE TWENTY YEARS SINCE YOU LOOKED GOOD IN A £$%&IN' RA-RA SKIRT, THAT'S FOR £$%&IN' SURE.

SOPHIE: HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! WHO ARE YOU?

BOO-BOO: I'M HER HOLY £$%&IN' GUARDIAN ANGEL, BRASS-BUTT.

BOO-BOO: MY NAME'S BOO-BOO RAMIREZ.

BOO-BOO: WHO THE £$%& ARE YOU?

SOPHIE: THE ANGEL BOO-BOO?

BARBARA: AW, GOD. AWW GOD...

BARBARA: SOPHIE, IT'S ME. WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN, EVERYBODY CALLED ME BOO-BOO. IT'S... AW, GOD...

BOO-BOO: HEY, BABY, DON'T CRY. WHO THE £$%& WAS YOU EXPECTIN' YOUR ANGEL TO BE, IF IT AIN'T ME?

BARBARA: AW, JEEZ. YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

BARBARA: AND LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE ALL STRONG. YOU DON'T TAKE NO CRAP FROM ANYBODY...

BOO-BOO: HEY. I'M HERE, OKAY? I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE. YOU KNEW THAT, RIGHT?

BOO-BOO: NOW COME ON. YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT SKINNY-ASS HUSBAND OF YOURS.

BARBARA: Y-YOU KNOW WHERE STEVE IS?

BOO-BOO: NAH, NOT EXACTLY. THE CARTOON-BOOK GUY THINKS HE'S A £$%&IN' WIZARD STRAIGHT OFF THE £$%&IN' CEREAL BOX, RIGHT?

BOO-BOO: MY GUESS, HE WON'T BE SATISFIED HERE. GUYS WHO THINK THEY'RE WIZARDS ALWAYS GOTTA CLIMB HIGHER. £$%&IN' MACHO ASSHOLES.

SOPHIE: UH...I'M SOPHIE, INCIDENTALLY. I'M BARBARA'S FRIEND.

BOO-BOO: HEY, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I WAS JUST KIDDIN' EARLIER.

BOO-BOO: I KNOW EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS. IT'S JUST SHE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING I KNOW.

BOO-BOO: YOU'RE OKAY, SOPHIE, THE OLD LADY HERE, SHE NEEDS A HOMEY LIKE YOU.

SOPHIE: SO...UH...WILL I MEET MY HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL HERE?

BOO-BOO: MAYBE NOT.

BOO-BOO: MAYBE YOU'RE ALREADY WEARIN' YOUR HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL, YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?

BOO-BOO: MAYBE SOPHIE BANGS' HIGHEST SELF RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THIS PROMETHEA DEAL YOU GUYS GOT GOIN' ON?

BARBARA: I-I'D TRUST HER, SOPH. SHE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

BOO-BOO: YEAH. MAYBE I DID, EXCEPT WITH THE BOYS.

BOO-BOO: ANYWAY, THERE'S MORE TO THIS PLACE THAN JUST MEETIN' ANGELS, BABYGIRL, TRUST ME.

BOO-BOO: THERE'S THE FOUR SIXES AND ALL THE PRINCES. THERE'S THE VISION OF HARMONY, THERE'S THE RISEN GODS...

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): AND I GUESS THEY'RE ALL A PART OF UNDERSTANDING THIS SPHERE, RIGHT?

BOO-BOO: YOU BET YOUR ASS. EVERYTHING HERE IS FULL O' MEANIN'. EVERYTHIN' REPRESENTS SOMETHING.

BOO-BOO: IT'S LIKE ONE O' THEM PHILOSOPHER GUYS SAID, JUST ABOUT ORDINARY HUMAN LIFE AND WHAT IT'S LIKE...

BOO-BOO: "MAN WALKS THROUGH A FOREST OF SYMBOLS."

SOPHIE: THOSE ARE THE FOUR TAROT PRINCES, AND ALL FOUR SIXES. THEY'RE ALLOCATED TO THIS SEPHIROTH, RIGHT?

SOPHIE: AND THAT IN THE CENTER, THAT'S APOLLO...

BOO-BOO: THAT'S RIGHT. GOD O' THE SUN. GOD O' MUSIC AND HARMONY.

SOPHIE: THE TAROT SIXES ALL LOOK SO BENEVOLENT: SUCCESS, SCIENCE, PLEASURE, VICTORY...

BARBARA: I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT APOLLO. HE'S GORGEOUS.

BOO-BOO: WELL, HE DID A PRETTY £$%&IN' GOOD JOB RUNNIN' THE AEGEAN REGION ALL THEM CENTURIES BACK.

SOPHIE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

BOO-BOO: I MEAN NONE O' THEM GREEK CITY-STATES MADE A MOVE WITHOUT CONSULTING APOLLO'S ORACLE AT DELPHI, RIGHT?

BOO-BOO: SO THERE'S THE PRIESTESS, THE PYTHIA. SHE'S SOME TEENAGE CHICK SITTIN' THERE STONED, OKAY?

BOO-BOO: SHE'S, LIKE, ON THIS PILLAR, IN ALL THESE FUMES, YEAH? MAYBE HEMP AN' STUFF.

BOO-BOO: SHE'S OUT OF IT, MAN. SHE'S TALKIN' ALL THIS GARBAGE...

BOO-BOO: BUT, LIKE, EVERYBODY TAKES IT AS INSTRUCTIONS STRAIGHT FROM APOLLO!

BARBARA: BOY. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A DISASTER WITH SOME TEENAGE STONER RUNNIN' THINGS.

BOO-BOO: UH-UH. THE GOD APOLLO. THAT'S WHO WAS RUNNIN' THINGS.

BOO-BOO: SO IT WAS A PROGRESSIVE, ENLIGHTENED, MOSTLY PACIFISTIC ERA, LIKE YOU'D EXPECT.

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT: EVERYTHIN' WORKS, FOR YEARS AN YEARS. APOLLO GOVERNED THINGS, AND HE DID GREAT...

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): ...SO, LIKE, WHAT'S IT MATTER IF HE WAS REALLY THERE OR NOT?

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

SOPHIE: I THINK SO. IT'S LIKE APOLLO'S NOT JUST THE GOD OF HUMAN ENLIGHTENMENT AND HARMONY, HE'S THE ESSENCE OF THOSE THINGS.

SOPHIE: HE'S HUMAN HARMONY ITSELF. WHERE IT IS, HE IS.

BOO-BOO: SURE. JUST LIKE APHRODITE IS HUMAN LOVE, OR HERMES IS HUMAN COMMUNICATION. I MEAN, THIS AIN'T £$%&IN' ROCKET SCIENCE!

BARBARA: WHAT ABOUT THESE GUYS UP AHEAD HERE? WHAT ARE THEY THE ESSENCES OF?

BOO-BOO: THESE? THESE ARE, LIKE, THE RISEN GODS. IT'S LIKE THE SUN. IT GOES AWAY EVERY NIGHT, THEN IN THE MORNING IT RISES. IT'S REBORN.

BOO-BOO: MR.GOODBUNS HERE, THAT'S BALDUR. BALDER THE BEAUTIFUL, FROM THE NORTHLANDS.

BOO-BOO: HE GETS KILLED BY LOKI, WHO'S GOD OF £$%&IN' WIT' PEOPLE, BUT THEN AFTER RAGNAROK AN' ALL THAT, TAA-DAAAA! BALDUR'S REBORN!

BOO-BOO: IT'S 'CAUSE HE'S BEAUTY, SEE? HE'S FOREVER!

BARBARA: I HEARD OF BALDUR. WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY, LOOKS LIKE HE SHOULD BE SELLING SWEETCORN?

BOO-BOO: OH, THIS IS MY MAN ATTIS. HE WAS SO CUTE, THE GODDESS CYBELE CASTRATED HIM SO NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE HIM.

BOO-BOO: ATTIS DIES, THEN COMES BACK AS TREES AND FLOWERS AND STUFF. FINALLY, DURIN' THIS FAMINE IN PHRYGIA,

BOO-BOO: CYBELE REVIVES HIM AS A CROP GOD.

SOPHIE: SO HE'S A SYMBOL OF RETURN, LIKE THE SOLAR DEITIES?

BOO-BOO: WELL, ATTIS IS MORE LIKE DIONYSUS HERE. IN THE ORPHIC MYTHS, ZEUS SCREWS DEMETER'S GIRL PERSEPHONE, SHE SQUATS OUT LITTLE DIONYSUS, OKAY?

BOO-BOO: ZEUS'S OLD LADY, HERA, SHE HIRES THESE TITAN GOONS TO TEAR THE KID TO BITS AND EAT HIM. ALL THEY LEAVE IS HIS HEART.

BOO-BOO: ATHENA, SHE GIVES THIS TO A MORTAL WOMAN, SEMELE, WHO EATS IT. NINE MONTHS LATER, DIONYSUS IS REBORN.

SOPHIE: REBORN LIKE THE VINE HE SYMBOLIZES. WHO'S THIS NEXT ONE? HE LOOKS EGYPTIAN...

BARBARA: AND MORBID. ALL THESE SYMBOLS OF DEATH AND DECAY. IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, ALL THAT ROT...IT'S SORTA PROFANE. IS THAT THE WORD?

BARBARA: BUT...I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THE FACT IT'S HERE MEANS THAT...WELL, THAT THE PROFANE IS KINDA SACRED TOO? DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, THAT'S...THAT'S REALLY PROFOUND. WOW. I MEAN, JESUS CHRIST...

BOO-BOO: YEAH.

SOPHIE: OH NO. OH NO...

BOO-BOO: OH YES. SEE, CRUCIFIXION, IT WASN'T JUST, LIKE, EXECUTIN' SOMEBODY.

BOO-BOO: IT WAS SOMETHING YOU'D DO TO A DOG.

BARBARA: OH GOD. OH GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT IT...

BOO-BOO: TO A DOG, MAN. A £$%&IN' DOG.

BOO-BOO: IT WAS DEGRADIN'. IT WAS HUMILIATIN'...

BOO-BOO: ...AND THEY DID IT TO HIM. TO HIM. YOU GET IT?

SOPHIE: I UNDERSTAND.

SOPHIE: WITH THIEVES.

SOPHIE: OH GOD. I UNDERSTAND...

BOO-BOO: OUR HIGHEST POINT. THE BEST IN US. THE GOLD.

BOO-BOO: AND IT'S NAILED WRITHING ON THE CROSS OF THE WORLD.

BOO-BOO: THAT'S US UP THERE, MAN.

BOO-BOO: BUT EVEN DOWN HERE, AT THE LOWEST AUSCHWITZ ASS-END OF WHAT HUMANS ARE, AND WHAT HUMANS DO...

BOO-BOO: ...OUR HIGHEST POINT IS STILL HERE WITH US.

BOO-BOO: THERE'S LIGHT. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT.

BOO-BOO: THERE'S LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM.

BARBARA: GOD...YOU SEE ALL THE PICTURES AND THE ICONS, BUT TO THINK HE REALLY EXISTED...

BOO-BOO: NO. THAT AIN'T IMPORTANT, WHETHER HE REALLY EXISTED. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT HE EXISTS.

BOO-BOO: WHAT HE MEANS, THE SYMBOL. THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S REAL. THAT'S HAPPENIN' RIGHT NOW.

BARBARA: YOU KNOW SO MUCH. I GUESS YOU'LL WALK WITH US A WAY THEN SPLIT LIKE AUSTIN DID, HUH?

BOO-BOO: HEY, HE'S SOME MAGICIAN WANTED TO GET IN YOUR PANTS. I'M YOUR HOLY £$%&IN' GUARDIAN ANGEL, DUMBASS.

BOO-BOO: I'M WITH YOU FOR THE DURATION.

BARBARA: AND HOW LONG'S THE DURATION?

BOO-BOO: DEPENDS. YOUR HUBBY THINKS HE'S A WIZARD, HE'S PROBABLY GONNA TRY CLIMBIN' THE TREE BY THE LIGHTNIN'-BOLT ROUTE. WHAT THEY CALL THE SWORD.

SOPHIE: WHAT'S THAT?

BOO-BOO: -HAHHHHH-

BOO-BOO: WELL, IT'S HOW THE ENERGY DESCENDS INTO THE UNIVERSE, INTO BEING, FROM GOD.

BOO-BOO: IT MOVES DOWN THROUGH ALL THE SPHERES FROM ONE TO TEN, FROM THE GODHEAD DOWN INTO PHYSICAL EXISTENCE IN THIS ZIG-ZAG PATH...

SOPHIE: HEY, EVERYTHING'S CHANGING COLOR...

ON SIGN: ROUTE 22

BOO-BOO: YEAH. THIS IS HIGHWAY TWENTY-TWO COMING UP.

BOO-BOO: LIKE I WAS SAYING TO BARB, WHAT MAGICIANS DO, THEY FOLLOW THE DOWNWARDS LIGHTNING-BOLT, BUT BACKWARDS.

BOO-BOO: THIS IS THE PATH CARTOON-BOOK GUY WOULD PROBABLY TAKE, FROM SPHERE SIX UP TO SPHERE FIVE...

BARBARA: BUT IF THIS SPHERE'S, LIKE, THE HIGHEST HUMAN POINT, THEN WHAT'S ABOVE IT?

BOO-BOO: WELL, THE LOWEST FIVE SPHERES, YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT HUMAN THINGS: FLESH, DREAMS, MIND, EMOTIONS, SPIRIT...

BOO-BOO: ABOVE THIS SIXTH SEPHIROTH, YOU'RE LOOKING AT BIG, UNIVERSAL QUALITIES.

BOO-BOO: UNIVERSAL WILL. UNIVERSAL LOVE.

SOPHIE: AND WHAT'S ABOVE THAT? WHAT'S ABOVE UNIVERSAL QUALITIES?

BOO-BOO: HEY, LET'S CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE COME TO IT, OKAY?

BOO-BOO: LET'S CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GET THERE AND YOU FIND OUT THERE AIN'T NO £$%&IN' BRIDGE!

BARBARA: HEY, LOOK! ARE THOSE ELEPHANTS?

SOPHIE: YES. I THINK THEY'RE THE ANIMAL SACRED TO...WHAT IS THIS TWENTY-SECOND PATH? JUSTICE?

BOO-BOO: USED TO BE. ALEISTER CROWLEY CALLED IT "ADJUSTMENT." HE SAID THE UNIVERSE AIN'T JUST, BUT IT'S PRECISE. IT'S PRECISELY ADJUSTED AND BALANCED.

BARBARA: SO WHAT'S THIS NEXT SPHERE?

BOO-BOO: THE FIFTH SPHERE? IT'S THE SPHERE OF MARS. IT'S RED AND IT'S FIERY.

BOO-BOO: WHEN ENERGY DESCENDS THE TREE INTO BEING, THE FIFTH SPHERE IS WHERE ANY IMPURITIES, ANYTHING UNWORTHY, GETS DESTROYED.

BOO-BOO: THIS JUSTICE PATH, LEADING TO IT, SORTA TELLS YOU ITS NATURE.

BOO-BOO: THE FIFTH SPHERE'S CALLED GEBURAH. THAT MEANS STRENGTH...

BOO-BOO: ...AND JUDGMENT.

CAPTION: NEXT: PANIC IN MANHATTAN...HELL ON EARTH...HAVOC IN HEAVEN... LIFE ON MARS.
