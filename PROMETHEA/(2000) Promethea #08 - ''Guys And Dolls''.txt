STACIA: SOPHIE? I-IS THIS GOING TO WORK?

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): I DON'T KNOW, STACE. JUST LET ME THINK...

STACIA: THEY'RE HOWLING. SOPHIE, THEY'RE HOWLING...

TRISH: UGGHH! I CAN SMELL THEM! THAT'S HORRIBLE...

DOCTOR: I...I FEEL FUNNY...

ON PAPER: Four women, and all Hell is was at the door, And so I thought where none had thought before. My plan was sound. There was no sacred law Holy writ, No predetermined rule forbidding it.  Had not past writers made their lovers loved ones be A vessel for their Muse's majesty? Yet it occurred to me to attempt do still more, For, if with one, why not with three or four?  That doctor, such love compassion in her face, Who seemed to me not unlike Margaret Case... Might thus provide a fleshly chariot for That loving angel seraph from the fields of War.

ON PAPER: Or might my Mother's life contain less strife harm If she possessed Bill Woolcott's female charm?  Would my companion Stacia's caustic wit Together with Grace Brannagh's make a fit?  That fortunate event eventuality Would leave nobody untransformed save me.  As for Myself, I'll conjure with a single line The fiction of a woman mortal made divine.  Eyes dark with kohl, her breath like ocean breeze, There in her hand the wand of swift Hermes.  Winged god of writers scribes, who writes the fates of men With the Caduceus as his wand , his pen.  By his art, let Her blazing form descend On me, alike with Mother, stranger, friend.  And in each soul let burn a single star  Whose light is all Mankind's:

DOCTOR (OFF PANEL): WHAT'S...? WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME? I'M...

TRISH: OH GOD...

STACIA: JESUS. SOPHIE? I-IS IT YOU DOING THAT?

STACIA: OH GOD. SOPHIE, LOOK, REALLY, DON'T DO THIS...

TRISH (OFF PANEL): SOPHIE! SOPHIE, HELP ME! EVERYTHING'S CHANGING! I'M...

TRISH (OFF PANEL): AAAA!

STACIA (OFF PANEL): SOPHIE BANGS, YOU TOTAL BITCH! DON'T YOU DARE...

STACIA (OFF PANEL): UKK...
