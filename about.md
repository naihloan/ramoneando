☺️ Hey, thanks for coming over. 

🏆 I´m Benji: a Product Manager working in tech over the past 5+ years.
I also have a background with a masters´ degree as a Sociologist. And I´m now finishing my thesis as a System´s Analyst. Best-case scenario I aim that all these skills bundle up together in the long run. I aim to build tech products with real-world impact.

👾 Fun fact: I've researched urban art, and always aim to learn more about User Experience [UX]. 

🎤 Builder presentation: I did an incubation project in 2023 and presented at ETHargentina. Ongoing.
