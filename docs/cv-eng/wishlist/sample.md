-   *Explain in 3 paragraphs or less what Smart Lists are, and why a
    user might be interested in using them.*

    Smart Lists are interactive To Do lists. They have the capability of
    making further anotations once you have moved on with activities,
    accomplished set goals, and change priorities if needed. One of the
    interesting points about using Smart Lists is that you can keep
    track of which are the points of the list that are properly being
    attended to, and those that are running slowly behind. There are
    plenty of reasons to use Smart Lists, and they vary widely. We hope
    that you find several uses to them.

-   *A user is experiencing a problem with the web app only partially
    loading. Respond to the user suggesting that they clear their cache
    (feel free to include any other troubleshooting steps you think
    might help them).*

    Hello! We are happy that you are using the Remember The Milk app! If
    the web app does not load fully you can make it work by cleaning the
    cache. This is quite simple, in most web browsers it is a matter of
    accessing through settings/advanced settings and set \*Clear
    browsing data\*. Please let us know if this solved the problem. As a
    shortcut it is also possible to try simply shutting down the browser
    and then reopening the app, this may be helpful to reset the app.

    best cutting edge technology we have raised our standard to the

    that shift and enjoy using our app. Please let us know if this
    instruction is of help for you to use Remember The Milk on your
