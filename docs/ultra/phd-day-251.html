<p>It is noticeable that all products that are promoted and sold in the context of ultra races are either related to consumption of nutrients for running before, during and after race; or the equipment, in general for outdoor activities, aside from running. Which all together is clearly opposed to the majoritarian forces in televised spectacles of team sports that promote other less athletic consumptions.
