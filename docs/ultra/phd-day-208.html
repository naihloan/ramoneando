<p>Understanding a tip of iceberg of the tarahumara ritual festivities I can't but fathom the idea that affect is an important core of what interests me. So McDougal is focused on the foot and barefoot potential and delves in detail into this in chapter 25. Castaneda's account is, McD suggests, also about the same Mexican tribe with intended anonymity. <em>Las ense√±anzas de Don Juan</em> becomes a cognitive account of how we see reality. But maybe it's even more than that. What in the emotional and spiritual realm else is there to rescue?</p>
<p>Other guides pointing in that direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerouac</li>
<li>Bukowski</li>
<li>Artaud</li>
<li>Don Quixote + Sch√ºtz</li>
<li>Swedenborg</li>
<li>Odyssey</li>
<li>Mauss</li>
<li>Galloway, Jeff. 2016 | <em>Mental Training for Runners : No More Excuses!</em>. I endorse the following books and highly recommend them:
<ul>
<li><em>Biology of Belief</em> by Bruce Lipton (Hay House, Inc, 2005)</li>
<li><em>Molecules of Emotions</em> by Candace B. Pert (Scribner, 1997)</li>
<li><em>The Mindbody Connection</em> by John E. Sarno (Wellness Central, 1998)</li>
