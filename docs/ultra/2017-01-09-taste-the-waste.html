<p>the worse consecuence of dumplands is that they produce huge amounts of <mark>methane</mark>, a gas that worsens the green house effect and attacks the ozone layer. this is produced simply by trapped oxygen in between layers of trash. so if you chop your trash into pieces you can reduce the methane produced by half. the effect would be similar to taking one out of every two cars.</p>
