<p><em>It's a very individual sport. I have to take every single step to get from the start to the finish. But I don't know that I could or necesarily would want to, without the energy that comes out from the community. I think everybody has the oportunity to find something that speaks to them.

And sometimes that another person, or something within.&quot;</h6>
<p>There's so much more to racing than just crossing the finish line. The first thing for me is being in that setting and having a good time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wining is not the priority. I love running! I want to be happy when I'm running. I want to be smiling, want the people that there with me to have a good time. I want that kind of energy going.</em></p>
