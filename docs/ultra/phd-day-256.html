<p>In the 70s the idea become that if you could run a marathon you would be immune to heart attack: this is a urban myth.</p>
<p>Risk? 1 to 100 000. The presenter enters a discussion with friend and editor in chief Amby Burfoot at Runner's World.</p>
<p>Perhaps endurance running does not add years to your life, nor adds life to your years. This is the possible conclusion that the presenter is showing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No single step you can take in your life to ensure robust health and remarkable longevity than a habit of daily exercise.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="the-dose-makes-the-poison">The dose makes the poison</h5>
<p>Like any potent drug:</p>
<ul>
<li>too little = no benefit</li>
<li>too much = harm</li>
</ul>
<p>Troponin level goes up at the end of marathons: heart muscle has died, micro stretches from growth. A sacred component for cardiologists. Not a big deal once in a while. It heals. But along the decades ... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phidippides_cardiomyopathy">Phidippides cardiomyopathy</a>.</p>
<p>Finding: After a 15-30 year study, it does not add longevity if you run further than 25 miles a week. On speed same thing: at 8 miles per hour same happens, the benefits went away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise does give benefits, but</li>
<li>More is not better</li>
<li>Yes, do some high intensity intervals, but that's it</li>
</ul>
