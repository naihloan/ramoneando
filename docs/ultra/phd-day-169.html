<h1 id="running50milesacrossthegrand¬†canyon">Running 50 Miles Across the Grand¬†Canyon</h1>

<p>Running Mt. Whitney has been on my bucket list for over two years.
Towering at 14,500 ft (4,420 meters), Mt. Whitney is the highest summit
in the contiguous United States. Next week we are going to run Mt.
Whitney. As I get ready for this run, I remember my rim to rim to rim,
Grand Canyon Run.</p>

<p>All this changed just four years ago when my daughter asked me to run a
half-marathon with her. I thought I would just go out, run and complete
a bucket list item. Little did I know that I was in no position even to
run even half a mile. After just a short run around the block I was out
of breath, my knees were hurting and my back pain was unbearable. After
several weeks of attempting to run, and failing miserably, I realized
that I did know how to run. In an effort to get better, I attended a Chi
Running workshop and learned the basics of running biomechanically
correct. Since then I never looked back. I remember the exhilaration I
felt when I completed my first 5K with ease and no pain. I felt great
and there was a sense of accomplishment. The 5K quickly turned into
10Ks, and half-marathons turned into full marathons.</p>

<p>¬†Last month one of my ultra-running friends asked to run the Grand
Canyon from Rim to Rim and back (R2R2R) to celebrate his 60th birthday.
I had no idea someone would even want to celebrate their birthday like
that. As I researched more about R2R2R running, I came across
the<a href="http://www.ancestorinfo.com/grand_canyon_of_arizona%20quotations.htm">writing of John Stoddard way back in
1898</a>{.markup&#8211;anchor
.markup&#8211;p-anchor}: ‚Äú‚Ä¶a descent into the Canyon is essential for a
proper estimate of its details, and one can never realize the enormity
of certain valleys, till he has crawled like a maimed insect at their
base and looked thence upward to the narrowed sky.‚Äù I realized I wanted
to check firsthand how a maimed insect felt. So I decided to run the
Grand Canyon, from South Rim to North Rim and back.</p>

<p>Last month, with fear, excitement and uncertainty, I descended into the
Canyon in the early morning, just before 5 a.m., with butterflies in the
stomach and headlamps lighting the way. It felt like I was stepping into
the abyss. We ran through rain, freezing cold, snow, hot weather and
heavy winds. I witnessed sunrise, sunset and pitch black darkness. As I
ran the distances were unchanging, the terrain was unrelenting, and the
uphill was brutal and grueling. I had no idea that I could keep running
through all this, for 17 hours straight. After a long 52-mile run, I
reached the <a href="http://www.bobspixels.com/kaibab.org/bc/gc_ep_ba.htm">Bright Angel
trailhead</a>{.markup&#8211;anchor
.markup&#8211;p-anchor} parking lot. It was past 10 PM and the place was
deserted. My poor wife after waiting for several hours left by the last
bus. There was no one else to greet. No rewards or medals. I was sore
but I felt good and found a new meaning in the expression ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dOsbsuhYGQ">Hurts So
Good</a>{.markup&#8211;anchor
.markup&#8211;p-anchor}.‚Äù</p>

<p>Running the Grand Canyon was the hardest thing I have ever done. I do
not know what makes people to do crazy thing. But as far as running is
concerned, I think</p>

<h5 id="thereissomethingprimalaboutrunning.">there is something primal about running.</h5>

<p>Humans have
an inherent love and ability for running. Our ancestors with no tools
and technology had to run for their life. They ran for food, ran away
from danger and perhaps ran just for fun, like other animals. Our family
dog Kiya, a beautiful Siberian husky, often runs as if there is nothing
more exciting than running. She runs just for the sake of running. We
see horses and many other animals run just for no reason. Running brings
some other side benefits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all running costs nothing. It is the cheapest form of exercise. All you have to do is just go out and run.
You don‚Äôt need to have a partner or a team. Just you.
You can feel the positive impact of running on your health in a matter of days. You will lose weight, reduce blood pressure and cholesterol.
Each run gives you great satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.
Running clears your minds from worrisome and mundane tasks. It helps you look at problems from a different perspective.
Running has no age limits. You can start running any time. Just last week, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/us/san-diego-marathon-oldest-woman-finishes/">Harriette Thompson, a 92 year old woman completed a marathon in San Diego</a>{.markup&#8211;anchor .markup&#8211;li-anchor}.
You will look a lot younger.
You will be happier and healthier</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with the development of engineering and technology, we
are losing our love and the ability for running. Running is easy and
fun. Start small. Aim for a 5K in two or three months. Increase your
mileage gradually. For guidance, read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ChiRunning-Revolutionary-Approach-Effortless-Injury-Free/dp/1416549447/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">Chi Running
book</a>{.markup&#8211;anchor
.markup&#8211;p-anchor} or attend a workshop.</p>

<p>I started running when most people stop running. So what‚Äôre you waiting
for? Just go out and run!</p>
