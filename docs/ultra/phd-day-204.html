<p>I woke up from coma. And started running.</p>
<p>You can make up quite a good amount of lies to begin with and you're already in. I have never <del>been</del> felt a runner in the past or now. Nor have I identified with a single or couple pair of labels to say or know who I am. Perhaps I do feel like a family person, sometimes a friend. In both cases with intermittent even if mild crisis once in a while.</p>
<p>I enjoy jogging, even when not too attached or serious. Perhaps I could do an experiment. What would happen if I simply commit to run 3K every morning? This is still hypothetical. But what happens if I run a certain amount: let's say to add up an average of 50K per week, 200K per month, 2400K per year. And add up a certain (small) amount of stretching and some strength training. This would be a mild version of Rory Bosio which could at least give some peace of mind and a change of pace in daily activities and desired to leave behind some physical limitations. No serious limitations but I feel bad that sometimes stiff I can't easily cut my toenails or tie my shoelaces.</p>
<p>What if?</p>

<p>Good influence on the Mirnavator. If she condsiders herself a runner that should suffice. Or does the general opinion matter?</p>
