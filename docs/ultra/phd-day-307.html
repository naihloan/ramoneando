        <p>Un art√≠culo habla de c√≥mo divagar, simplemente ponerse a pensar puede ser altamente productivo, m√°s de lo que indicar√≠a la abstracci√≥n de sentarse sin hacer nada concreto. Ya el t√≠tulo indica c√≥mo lo implementaron <strong>grandes genios de la humanidad</strong>.</p>
<p>Lo que no dejo de pensar es en el reverso de la situaci√≥n. ¬øQu√© pasa con pensar demasiado? Ese fue el camino a la locura de muchos ajedrecistas. En fin, ac√° la parte saludable refiere a so√±ar en una <em>cierta</em> medida y cantidad:</p>

<p><em>At their core, a healthy amount of daydreaming and reflection enable memory consolidation, and they allow non-linear connections to form, which both help our ability to break down and target issues and look at them through a new lens. /// The daily mind-wandering that occurs here and there for most of us helps with this, but a deeper and more purposeful effort can yield a disproportionately greater reward.</em></p>

<h5 id="introducing-the-2-hour-rule">Introducing the 2-hour rule</h5>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once a week, usually on Thursdays, I block out a 2-hour period of my day just to think. /// In the evening, I remove all possible distractions, especially electronics like my phone and my laptop, and I basically lock myself in a room to question my work and my lifestyle with a pen and a notebook. 2 hours is a long time, and some of it will feel unproductive and not all of it will be structured, but I have a few general things that I almost always start off with to set me in motion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Here are a few questions I reflect on:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>_Am I excited to be doing what I‚Äôm doing or am I in aimless motion?</li>
<li>Are the trade-offs between work and my relationships well-balanced?</li>
<li>How can I speed up the process from where I am to where I want to go?</li>
<li>What big opportunities am I not pursuing that I potentially could?</li>
<li>What‚Äôs a small thing that will produce a disproportionate impact?</li>
<li>What could probably go wrong in the next 6 months of my life?_</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I can quite honestly say that this is the highest return activity in my life. It forces me to balance the short-term with the long-term. I catch problem before they become problems, and I‚Äôve stumbled onto efficiencies and ideas that I wouldn‚Äôt have come across otherwise. /// Interestingly enough, much of the value doesn‚Äôt come out of the routine questions, but from the time I have left after I run out of things to think about. It‚Äôs when I let my mind wander.</em></p>

<p><em>In the article &quot;Malcolm Gladwell got us wrong,&quot; the researchers behind the 10,000-hour rule set the record straight: Different fields require different amounts of deliberate practice to become world class. /// If 10,000 hours isn't an absolute rule that applies across fields, what does it really take to become world-class in the world of work? /// Over the past year, I've explored the personal history of many widely admired business leaders like Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg to understand how they apply the principles of deliberate practice. /// What I've done does not qualify as an academic study, but it does reveal a surprising pattern. /// Many of these leaders, despite being extremely busy, set aside at least an hour a day (or five hours a week) over their entire career for activities that could be classified as deliberate practice or learning. /// I call this phenomenon <a href="https://medium.com/@michaeldsimmons/why-constant-learners-all-embrace-the-5-hour-rule-8836f554da1">the five-hour rule</a>.</em></p>
