<p>Barcelona icon <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/lionelmessi/index.html">Lionel Messi</a> has candidly spoken about having to administer his own childhood hormone injections.</p>
<p>Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone disorder, otherwise known as idiopathic short stature, which resulted in him having to inject his own legs every night.</p>
<p>'I injected my legs once every night,' he told America TV. 'I started at 12 years old. It was not something that left an impression on me.'¬†</p>

<p>He added: 'At first my parents gave me the injections from when I was eight years old until I learnt. It was a small needle. It did not hurt, it was something routine for me that I had to do and I did it with normality.'</p>
<p>It also brought about a huge financial outlay for his family. Messi's parents reportedly paid ¬£1000 a month for the hormones until the Argentina striker's first club, Newell's Old Boys, offered to help with the payments.</p>
<p>He was then picked up by Barcelona and moved from South America in 2001, aged just 13, to train at the famous La Masia academy.</p>
<p>The Catalan giants then offered to pay for all his medical treatment until he finished the course of injections the following year.</p>

<p>'It was not very difficult for me to come to Barcelona,' said the 30-year-old. 'I adapted quickly but my family did not. My siblings wanted to go back and they did.</p>
<p>'I was left alone with my father and he asked me &quot;What should we do?&quot;, I told him &quot;I want to stay&quot;.'</p>
<p>It's safe to say the condition did not affect the player's career trajectory. He has managed 374 goals in 410 outings for Barcelona and claimed five Ballon d'Or awards.</p>
<p>He will also lead his country at this year's World Cup in Russia, hoping to secure their first world title since 1986.¬†</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/growth-hormone-deficiency">Great Ormond Street Hospital‚Äôs website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland located deep inside the brain.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human Growth Hormone has been used by athletes to dope in the past ‚Äì and is on <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/questions-answers/human-growth-hormone-hgh-testing">Wada</a>‚Äôs banned substances list, but there is no suggestion Messi has violated any Wada rules. According to Wada, benefits of use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;include the reduction of body fat (lipolysis), the increase in muscle mass and strength (anabolic effect), as well as its tissue-repairing effects (recovery) on the musculo-skeletal system.&quot;</p>
