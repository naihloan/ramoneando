<ul>
<li>When I was younger I had ripped abs and didn't even notice. It's just that I did a lot of running just because. A bit for fun, a bit for mental cleansing, another bit just for no reason out of habit, and so on. Now my cousin A asked me if I was running and told me that last summer the difference is very noticeable. Curious note: in the past I didn't even have a mirror, I thought it would be too vain and had no need anyway.</li>
<li>I also used to believe that the mind and the soul were the same thing. Perhaps a higher level of spiritual growth made them be in sync?</li>
<li>On another note I didn't run today because my lumbar (or butt?) was hurting after yoga and didn't want to worsen.</li>
</ul>
