<h4>Julian Friedmann at TEDxEaling</h4>
<p>Aristotle says there are 3 principles for good story telling:</p>
<ul>
<li>pity, so that audience connects to character. And if the character continues to suffer, then the audience can -because of emotional investment- feel the following,</li>
<li>fear. and when the character gets set free from this, the audience can experience the next:</li>
<li>catharsis, which is a result, not of intelectual processes but, of emotional and chemical reactions in the bloodstream, namely PEA (phenil ethil alamine), or the happyness drug. speed and ecstasy also produces this, as chocolate and sex.</li>
</ul>
