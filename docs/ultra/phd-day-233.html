<p>Break a sweat wherever, whenever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.self.com/topic/strength-training">Strength training</a> at the gym or taking a class at a fitness studio is great, but sometimes, you just want to get in your workout at home‚Äîor on vacation, or on a work trip, or wherever you may be. While most of us don't have round-the-clock access to a full gym stocked with weights and <a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-weight-machines-fit-into-fitness-routine">machines</a>, the truth is that you really can work your entire body without them. Of course, equipment can help and is great for progressing and diversifying a workout program. But if you want to just get moving and do some strength and cardio work wherever you are, that's completely doable with a <a href="https://www.self.com/story/20-minute-bodyweight-workout">bodyweight workout</a>.</p>
<p>The workout below, created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jsimsfit/">Jess Sims</a>, NASM-certified personal trainer and instructor at Classpass Live, Shadowbox, and Fhitting Room in New York City, challenges your entire body and doesn't require a single piece of equipment. &quot;It‚Äôs a full-body, dynamic workout that includes strength, power, mobility, and cardio,&quot; Sims says. &quot;It‚Äôs also great because it‚Äôs customizable‚Äîif you have less than 20 minutes, you can do the circuit one time, or if you have more than 20 minutes you can do it three times.&quot;</p>
<p>The workout includes a <a href="https://www.self.com/story/option-1-warm-up">dynamic warm-up</a> to get your blood flowing and prep your body for the rest of the work ahead, and a cool-down to help you slow back down and wrap it all up. If you want to make the workout more challenging‚Äîmaybe you've done it a handful of times and are ready to turn things up a notch‚Äîadd weights to the lunge and squat movements. You can also, like Sims said, add another round of the main strength circuit.</p>
