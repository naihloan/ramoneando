<blockquote>
<p><em>The struggle between organism and environment is nature‚Äôs paradigm, but this is often underplayed in human endeavors. We consider ourselves separate from other animals because we adapt to new environments, in part, by rational action. Thus, the book‚Äôs underlying theme is the role of behavior in adaptation, emphasizing circumstances in which human technology will forever change the environment, such as after a nuclear war or during colonization of space. Once the subtle interplay of environment with the body‚Äôs responses and the individual‚Äôs behavior is grasped, a new window opens onto human survival.</em> [p. viii]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The debate over human evolution is beyond the scope of the book, which deals with the individual, for whom the outcome of environmental stress can be reduced to tolerance and adaptation or death. These outcomes, however, have important ramifications for the long-term survival of humans both on this planet and elsewhere in the solar system. Thus, understanding how individuals adapt to the environment is a step on the road to discovering how the physical world shapes human biology.</em>[p. xix]</p>
