<p>I have to be careful of people learning to drive when I want to cross streets. Many people are doing there 1st drives in Parque Sarmiento. You can tell because of the intense faces of the driver and they always go with someone in the co-pilot seat. Also, some cars have labels like <em>driving school</em>.</p>
<p>Check several references in related topics: Ekman's <em>Telling Lies</em> on facial micro expressions, taxi driver's ethnography, Perlongher on public space. Also Edensor and Urry.</p>
