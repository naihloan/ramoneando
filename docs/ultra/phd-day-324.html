<h4 id="friday-7-november-2008"><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/alan-latham-the-french-intellectuals-are-wrong-running-is-good-for-the-mind-997957.html">Friday 7 November 2008</a></h4>
<p>In June 2007, soon after the election of the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, a debate broke out in the French media about their new president's jogging habit. &quot;Western civilisation,&quot; the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut claimed on national television, &quot;in its best sense, was born with the promenade. Walking is a sensitive, spiritual act,&quot; while &quot;jogging is management of the body. The jogger says I am in control. It has nothing to do with meditation.&quot;</p>
<p>In a similar vein the daily newspaper Libération wondered, &quot;Le jogging est-il de droite?&quot; (Is jogging right wing?). There is a prejudice towards sustained physical recreation activity that is deep-seated in the European intellectual tradition.</p>

<p>Beyond the hucksterism, Sheehan was a cardiologist for whom running was a way of gaining perspective. And his idea, that exercise can improve mental aptitude, has been born out by subsequent scientific research.</p>
