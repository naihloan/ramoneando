<p>a dog (dead or not?), garbage (too much laying), roller bladers (another park tribe), a tile to stumble upon (non horizontal light in the darkness is not enough like in rally), a biker with no lights or helmet is dangerous for both him and me when there is no street lamp light. this happens both in the back of the park zoo and in plaza espa√±a which has a huge round about but still they are missing spotlights to work properly. is local energy company cutting costs? big state-financial problem there. another tribe with which I sympathize because of rhythm: batucadas murgas uruguayan beat music</p>

<ul>
<li>needed to check my quad pain in chirunning reference book. I might have been stepping ahead with long strides. also I might have been bending at the waist. even so, mild problems in a good run.</li>
<li>needed to cut my nails, those getting to long and crashing against the end of the foot can hurt.</li>
<li>even if i enjoy sprinting, i feel closer to the turtle <del>or tortoise</del> than the rabbit <del>hare</del>. do other runners, and ultra runners, have these ideas and icons in mind? if not: others?</li>
