<h3 id="quotes-on-running-and-human-endurance">100 Quotes on Running and Human Endurance</h3>
<h4 id="by-ed-ayres">by <a href="http://enduranceandsustainability.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/100-quotes-on-running-and-human.html">Ed Ayres</a></h4>
<p>       For fun, but also for inspiration and enlightenment, I decided to put together a collection of 100 quotes about that most fundamental activity of our species, <em>the human race</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quotes I found range from whimsical to profound--sometimes in the same breath (see Dr. Suess).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I was especially fascinated by how universally evocative running seems to be not just to those of us who run for sport, but to philosphers, scientists, and even U.S. presidents (Thomas Jefferson, John F. Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter), as well as to some of the giants of literature and the arts (Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Joyce Carol Oates). And of course, let's not leave out actual runners, from Clarence DeMar to Kathrine Switzer to the guy who may have written more about running than anyone else on our crowded planet, Joe Henderson. I hope you won't mind that I'm also including a scattering of quick takes from my book <em>The Longest Race</em>, which will be out on October 9.<br />

10. &quot;There are clubs you can't belong to, neighborhoods you can't live in, schools you can't get into, but the roads are always open.&quot;<br />

                --<em>The Longest Race</em><br />
17.    “They say a good love is one that sits you down, gives you a drink of water, and pats you on top of the head. But I say a good love is one that casts you into the wind, sets you ablaze, makes you burn through the skies and ignite the night like a phoenix; the kind that cuts you loose like a wildfire and you can't stop running simply because you keep on burning everything that you touch! I say that's a good love; one that burns and flies, and you run with it!”                  --C. Joybell C.<br />
18. &quot;A city that outdistances man's walking powers is a trap for man.&quot;<br />

                --Yiannis Kouros, holder of multiple world ultra records, as quoted in TheTrailJogger<br />

I've been looking for the effective gear to improve my runs and stumbled upon militarygradenutritionals.com/blog/. Besides many useful tips, I have also read there about natural nutritional supplements, which help athletes and military to enhance their endurance. I have tried their NavySeal Formula by myself and was impressed how quickly my tone went up. I was able to double my distances and had enough energy even after the finish! This product makes my trainings much more effective.</p>

<dd>I've been running competitively for 54 consecutive years, and love it as much now as I did when I joined my high school cross-country team in 1956. Competitive highlights: Finishing 3rd in the first New York Marathon, in 1970; 3rd in the U.S. 50-Mile championship in 1976 (in 5:46); 1st in the JFK 50-Mile in 1977; 1st in four U.S. national age-division championships at 50K road, 50K trail, and 50 miles. I was the founding editor of Running Times magazine, now published by Runner's World parent Rodale Press. In recent years, my interests have expanded to exploring a theory that mental, emotional, and spiritual fitness require serious exercise as much as physical fitness does. It's a growing problem for the world, and especially for America! It's not just obesity that has become epidemic, but mental and spiritual passivity! I explore this idea in my website www.willhumansendure.com.
