<p>Murakami's wrists had the worst side on pain after running his first ultra. Possible reasons? Maybe this is the only part that is used to be tense, because writing doesn't have as much body self awareness as when running. Also, I'd say he doesn't use dvorak nor vim: as they say, <a href="https://youtu.be/wlR5gYd6um0?t=228"><em>you edit more than writing</em></a>.</p>
