<h2 id="series-vs-sport">Series vs Sport</h2>
<p>Both McFly my brother, and Caco my brother and law, do not like getting addicted to series because they get confined indoors. I like them, recently: Merl√≠, The Good Place (both series teach moral philosophy, with highlights on Aristotle's sociability and Utilitarianism pragmatism), Stranger Things. I like series and I believe that we can do all that we want. Time, of course, is key.</p>
<h2 id="you-and-your-plastic-brain">You and your Plastic Brain</h2>
<h2 id="neuroplasticity">Neuroplasticity</h2>
<p>Is present not only in childhood but at all ages in several ways, at least three here. 1. Chemical. Short term improvement in motor skill 2. Structural-Physical Change. Long term memory change in a motor skill. Example: people who read braille have higher sensitivity in their hands. Your dominant brain region is bigger than the other. That is, if your right handed, your left brain hemisphery is the largest. 3. Functional changes altering functions. Increase excitability of brain regions.</p>
<h4 id="what-limits-and-enables-neuroplasticity">What limits and enables Neuroplasticity?</h4>
<p>Research: Recovery from stroke</p>
<p>How to increase quality and changes of learning? - Brain stimulation. Variability - Exercise - Robotics</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity runs both ways! It can be positive, but it can be negative, cronic pain, no memory, addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>Consequence: We all need practice to learn. But not all will learn at the same pace. Popular belief says that you can learn and master a motor skill in 100 000 hours. But some may take more, or some may take less.</p>
<p>Personalized medicine can optimize outcomes. In cancer, genetics can be used to apply different treatment to each patient. The same may be said for recovery from stroke. Brain structure and functions can be seen as Brain Markers: help to relate patients to specific treatments.</p>
<p>Aside from Medicine, we could be personalizing Education: both as Learner and as a Teacher. This is part of why some excel in sports, or languages, or whatever. Each one changes there brain differently.</p>
