<p>1.1 Reclaiming a Broader and Deeper Notion of Affectivity</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Affective scientists, focus especially on primarily short-lived <em>emotions</em>.] Affective scientists also (although more rarely) study moods, which they see as differing from emotions mainly in intensity and duration, in particular as being less intense and longer lasting than emotions.¹</p>

<li>Throughout the book, I use the term “body” to refer to the organism “minus” the brain (and, relatedly, I use the term “organism” to refer to the brain and body together). By “brain” I refer only to a part of the central nervous system—the one that, in vertebrates, is located within the skull (in vertebrates, the central nervous system also includes the spinal cord). I often follow convention in using “neural activity” in place of “brain activity,” although it is important to remember that brain activity does not reduce to neural activity but includes biochemical activity; conversely <strong>there is “neural activity” going on in the body as well, in the peripheral (somatic) nervous system, as well as the autonomic or visceral one</strong> (whose divisions—sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric—all include a host of neurons and ganglia).</li>

<p>Again: listen to your own body / <em>Active Listening</em></p>
