<h2 id="downloaded-app-faboulous">Downloaded APP | Faboulous</h2>
<p>I downloaded an app to feel better. Physicaly one of my major limitations was feeling bloated, with no energy; or better and simpler put: with a headache during several hours, sometimes a day, after a run. And this even if I felt no muscular effort, nor felt tired. I believe that this is due to poor nutrition and other factors not well known.</p>
<p>So I've changed/made conscious of some new good habits.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A glass of water first thing in the morning.</li>
<li>A breakfast with protein: mostly an egg or 2 with milk, scrambled, with a couple of almonds and green tea.</li>
<li>Exercise three times a week.</li>
</ol>
