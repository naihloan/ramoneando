<p>So it was wery humid and hot and I needed to stop to take a very brief leak where no one could see me. The only other time that I needed to do this there was a public bathroom but now I couldn't find one (now I realize that the pool has bathrooms, not sure if open at these hours). In front of the stairs. Hope not causing offenses.</p>
<p>Most part of this public space was very well designed nearly a century ago. Although the water is stagnating. Another point to consider is the variating functionalities the space has for different people: several different &quot;food trucks&quot; as <em>choripanes</em>, hot dogs, french fries; street vendors of several products such as other local foods, artisan work. By night all of these live together in a small space along with prostitutes.</p>
