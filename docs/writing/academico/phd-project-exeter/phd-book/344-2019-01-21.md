## Escaping through ultra | The useless art of running away and outside

Running is mostly useless, it has no defined purpose, no goal, and just wanders through space with repetitive motion. You could achieve many other health and sanity objectives through many other means. You can even do without any of the prior and still live a life of wellness. And yet, there is some attraction and accessibility, and a good quota of mysterious simplicity in running that pulls so much an increasing population into that vortex. And going from running to ultra adds more simplicity and even complexity on what you can learn of use to the practice and about broader areas as well. 

Never run, nor go ultra. How and where could you find the urge to go outside? You can find that in many sources, and you can find many magnets to pull you indoors as well. This is an exploration on how to know more about love handles in the forties and how to hack them, about not what the heart but the soul craves and yearns about, on the idea that being a motionless blob with little reaction and agility does not feel lively when moving in a civilized era that does not call for physical challenge nor awareness on a daily basis. 

Is there art in going outside and away? Is there art in running?
