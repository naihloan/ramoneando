# Study Notes 

## People and Places

PV: _So, a request first, and then my answers to your questions. Could you, when you have time, create a separate sheet with brief "study notes" for us. The notes would include (1) information about who we are speaking with and (2) background information about what is significant about a place that we're going to visit with that person, or background about the issue that the person is telling us about. You don't need to write a thesis--just a few quick notes so we're feeling prepared._

BJ: _Two tasks here. One would be that you feel that the information is good enough, or if you would need me to inquire more. The other, is that you can notice now that most paid excursions have some prices so that you can double check if they are fine. To give closure to Chaltén it would be good to simply get approval on two excursions by Alejandro, and the rest should be more or less in place, mostly with a good strong verbal commitment by a new guide and team: Pipa. Also, if you review and want something else to be attended to: just let let me know and I'll see fit to that._\

+ Romina @ Waffle House [Cabañas Rivendel, Vannini's home at Chaltén]

> She's from Córdoba (Benji's place) and has lived South for 20 years. She graduated in Tourism and has always been in touch with outdoors. Her husband, Demián, has made maps and they both work closely with guides. Their history can be interesting because they are not locals, but have been there many years now. Also, the pictures of the place seems that they do have a nice outdoors to show, even if in middle of the town. In some way they may be compared/resembled to estancias.

+ Alfredo, Patricia @ Estancia LaQuinta [Chaltén]

> He is fourth generation of family living and working in the Estancia. Estancias here, like in the Dolomites, seem to have shifted a bit from raising farm animals to attending to tourism: in this case working with lodging. Patricia, his wife, I understand (someone else told me) is an historian and has wrote books on the area. Would be good to grasp one of those texts. 

+ Alejandro Luiz @ Okupa [Chaltén]

> Friend of my informant. He is called "the crazy man of the dogs", as another local said who gave me his phone and location/hours available. Seems a busy person, works by night, from 10 pm to 7am and then does his own activities. We spoke by phone and he understood the project we are embarked on. I asked if it was OK to have a conversation with him on the topic of his occupying a terrain where the landlords used to be his bosses: but now he does not have those bosses anymore. The topic of occupying real estate seems a little obscure/unclear but is there and interesting. The good point is that he has a fond memory of my informant Gustavo Giorgis, who now lives in my region. 

+ Alejandro Monteagudo @ Fitz Roy / Serac Expediciones [Chaltén]

> Salesman. He has prepared and offered the activities to do near Mount Fitz Roy. Valuable because the options are good to walk during a daily hike and understood and agreed with filming. `$210 USD` each activity (per our group of 4):

        * To Monte Fitz Roy, through Laguna de Los Tres + Laguna Torre. 4/6 kms
        * Reservas Los Huemules + Lago del Desierto. Picturesque places to film. 

+ Sofi @ Camping / Housing [Chaltén]

> She is a true mountain person who goes out for several days at a time, so it is hard to get in touch easily with her. But she is very friendly. She was who thought of considering the housing situation, noting that the real estate situation is not quite proper. I sent her the consent form so she could have more information on our project and she would show it to the landlord of the housing to see if he would be willing to open for interview. 

+ Thelma @ Glaciares Vespignani & Viedma [Chaltén]

> Saleswomen. She seems quite afar from hiking since she had to ask the people that use the boat for permission to film. Perhaps this is my own bias. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish salespeople and guides/hikers since sometimes the same person has to fulfill both roles and more. She offered to visit Glaciares Vespignani and Viedma, but someone else (Lina and Pipa) told me that Viedma had receded and not many agencies are doing that path in this season, then add that perhaps one can take a view from a different angle. At `$2250 per person [nearly $60 USD]`:

        * 2 Glaciars. Good to film freely. 

+ Sofi @ Proposal X [Chaltén]

> Same Sofi than above would offer some place to go but did not make a concrete proposition or price. Perhaps I should ask upwards, to whom gave me her phone (Camila and Luciano, who are some 1000 kms North, in Bariloche). Or perhaps let loose.

+ Lina @ Lodging Hosteria Lago Viedma [Chaltén]

> She, Lina, is a friend of a friend. She has a cabin that offers lodge to tourists. She has also studied film as a gruduate student. She lives with her girlfriend down South for what I believe is not so many years ago: maybe five? This gives variations in the type of residents of the area. She told me that by what we were interested she is willing to interview, and that she could recommend a safe guide: Pipa. 

+ Pipa @ Hiker / Mountaineer [Chaltén]

> Pipa offered 2 hikes [`$1650 USD for both activities together for our group of 4 persons`], and a climb [`$300 USD for group`], and an additional option to be discussed according to equipment and physical conditions:

        * Trekking Laguna Torre | 18 km | 8 hs | Difficulty: Low
        * Paso del Cuadrado | 10 kms | 7 hs | Vertical climb: 1200 meters
        * Rock Climbing | 6 hs | All levels 
        * Cerro Madsen | Two day hike near Monte Fitz Roy > single day if good hikers.

+ 2 Ideas @ On the Go [Chaltén & Calafate]

> 1. Maybe get a local artisan to weight in for more variety in socio-economic diversity. People working on sidewalks are very common in Argentina. Would be good to notice if the cold of South Weather leaves them out or if the affluence of tourism gives opportunity for temporal jobs.\
> 2. Perhaps consider *Urban Hitchhiking*. I got this idea from a recent 2018 paper by [Malla, Tuuli ; Kholina, Anna ; Jäntti, Lauri](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/30281). Maybe too far fetched.

+ Rolo @ TourismAgency LagoSanMartín > Estancia BonAccord [Calafate]

> Friend of my informant. Very helpful, and gave several details for assistance on the non traditional visit to the area. Offered to visit a less touristic place which is Estancia Bon Accord, with less people. Can also arrange for MarPatag (Gourmet Cuisine experience by boat, if I understood correctly). Also possible contacts with climbers of the Fitz Roy. (This may be covered by *Pipa* and team).

        * Estancia Bon Accord. To get to know about history and pioneers in the area.
        * MarPatag Gourmet Cuisine on Boat > Glaciares Upsala, Spegazzini, Perito Moreno.
        * Big Ice AR$ 6900 [roughly $185 USD] + Traslado AR$ 1000 (covered because of car)

+ Marcela @ Estancia Cristina. [Calafate]

> We already have plenty of estancias so I didn't insist on a specific date but told her about the project and seemed OK with all of it. Just that, as everyone else working in the area, if she can offer a guided paid tour around it would be a plus. She recommended visits to Glaciar Upsala and Lago Pearson. 

+ DafneMoreno @ Hike+Asado+Boat > Glaciar Perito Moreno [Calafate]

> Full Day Activity | Glaciar Sur Pioneros | Old highway #15 connects original populations, pioneers, and first arrivals. Estancia Nibepo Aike + asado at Glaciar Sur. Semirigid boat takes us to Glaciar Perito Moreno. Hike through Lenga Forrest and remain 2 hours in front of The Glaciar.  `$250 USD each`.

+ Gisela + Mariela + Rubén @ Glaciers Land
 
> My cousin gave a manager's course in October and gave me the 1st contact. They have a company that works providing services to tourists: guides, excursions, etc. As a second point, they are representatives of the regional companies that do the same kind of service, hence they can contact us with people in Chaltén as well. She gave me Mariela's contact and she further added that her husband Rubén is part of the Regional Representation of Calafate, and will help contact with National Park Manager.

+ Elsa Rodríguez @ Haberdashery

> Contact of my informant. Has worked in tourism a long time and now works in something totally different. I believe that such a mundane and different tone can be interesting by means of contrast. She may also help with other things too, since seems friendly and helpful.

+ Luis Callejas @ Centro de Interpretación Histórica [Archives]. 

> Expectable to find visual material. (Person in charge not available on the day of call). Auto-guided tour, 5 saloons, Pre-History + Originary Populations.

+ n/a @ Glaciurium

> Gift Shop. To add a little more of the commercial aspect. Recommended by other people who has travelled. Did not get a formal permission yet, although requested.

+ Pedro Esbarca @ Engineer / Glaciologist > Glaciarium

> Likes to talk about the local subject. Unsure what his actual profession is but may be useful to talk with him if he is active in restoring value to the place and has contributed and/or is activist for nature.
