**Start** \[00:01:09.0\]

**End** \[02:03:50.9\]

**MILENA:** [00:01:09.0] I'll be the only one carrying a microphone? I hope to not say too much nonsense [bullshit].
**Interviewer:** [00:01:15.2] We hope that you do! The looser, the better. We don't want a prepared script. 
**MILENA:** [00:01:25.3] I was just saying that. I always improvise. Because I think that's what people want. Not that you're reading a trick-guide and always say the same thing. I never say the same. 
**Interviewer:** [00:01:39.1] Over here I shitfaced! ... 
**MILENA:** [00:01:40.2] [Laughter]
**Interviewer:** [00:01:45.8] Over here I had sex ... 
**MILENA:** [00:01:48.9]  [Laughter] I won't say that. 
**MILENA:** [00:02:13.5] Oh. I didn't tell you ... The map! So if you continue the trail ... We are here. And we are going up to this point. If you continue the trail there is another longer trail that goes to Paso del Viento. Paso del Viento is a place where you can access to the ice cap. The Southern Patagonian Ice Field. 
 [00:02:44.4] Maybe you heard about that. We have a very very big ice cap. With the Northern Patagonian Ice Field, it's the third biggest mass of ice in the world. First it's Antarctica, then Greenland, and then the Southern and Northern Patagonian Ice Field. Well. From this point we are going to see Laguna Torre, and also Laguna Capri. 
 [00:03:14.4] I don't remember exactly if these two legs also. But it's a very big panoramic view. It's a very open place. And it's really nice. We can also see Viedma Lake to the other side. If we are lucky we can find some fossils on the trail. So we can see them and let them at the side to leave others to see them.
 [00:03:48.8] But we are not going to take them. Because it's part of the National Park. I have a place where I always put my ... My fossils? ... When I find them, to show them to people, so I'll show you. OK? Let's go. 
**MILENA:** [00:04:23.5] Oh what an embarrassment. Well, as I said, it's not allowed. It's 100, the tax [the fine], if we take fossils. 
**Interviewer:** [00:04:39.9] Do you often go to fossil sites? We have gone, in the last two years, to four. The last one we went to, there [...] were actually bones. Of the size of your legs. 
**MILENA:** [00:05:00.9] Wow!!! ... This is parabella. If you touch it, it's a very oily plant. We use for medicine too. It's good for haematoma and well the trout, the stomach too. I make some creams. With this. 
 [00:05:28.1] For pain. Muscles. It's a good thing. 
 [00:05:44.3] This is the pitío [Chilean flicker (Colaptes pitius)]. Do you hear the noise? This is a wood pecker. It's white and with some black lines. 
 [00:06:14.6] This is fifío. There are many birds, really nice birds. 
 [00:06:34.9] I don't know if they are ripe... They are not ripe! It's very sour right now. 
 [00:09:10.9] This is neneo [Mulinum spinosum, (neneo, hierba negra, hierba de la culebra)]. Mothers-in-law pillow!! ... Well it depends on your mother in law. Not all mothers-in-law are like this. I'm lucky. 
**Interviewer:** [00:10:18.6] Mine is cool. And I have a baby, 5 months now.
**MILENA:** [00:10:18.6] Oh!! So little! I have one too. 7 years old in just a couple of days. Satia. He's a boy. And we've been together with Ben for a short time. I had been alone for two years. Until I found Ben. 
 [00:11:02.0] So we're thinking about having another one. 
**Interviewer:** [00:11:15.1] Could you tell us where we are in the world? 
**MILENA:** [00:11:23.1] Oh look. In paradise. I don't know. I can't say. We are just right here right now. Look at this condor flying around us. We are in the perfect moment. In the perfect now. 
**Interviewer:** [00:11:56.4] Those are very big. 
**MILENA:** [00:11:58.0] Yes. Can be three metres from wing to wing. That's why it's very difficult for them to start flying. And so the condor's nest are always in vertical places like there, and the other side. So they can just jump and fly [glide]. And it takes two years for the babies to start flying. They spend two years with their parents. 
 [00:12:32.6] So they have only one egg every two years. They can live like 70 years. They are very long lived. 
**Interviewer:** [00:12:45.4] So paradise, what is that called. What is the town called? 
**MILENA:** [00:12:51.7] It's called El Chaltén. El Chaltén means the mountain that smokes and it's the word that the Tehuelches, or Aónikenk, gave to the mountain, to Fitz Roy. Because, well, it's a particularity that it's always smoking on the top. Because the winds that come from the West carry a lot of moister and so when the wind goes to the top and passes to the Supercanaleta, 
 [00:13:27.9] there's an ice channel in the West face of Fitz Roy, so all of this moister gets colder and becomes into clouds. And so it's always cloudy or smokey on the top of Fitz Roy Mountain. And so Fitz Roy is the name of the captain, a Beagle Captain, from Darwin's expedition. 
 [00:13:55.2] When Perito Moreno came here he gave this name, in honor of this person, Fitz Roy. 
**Interviewer:** [00:14:12.4] People outside of Argentina are not familiar with Benito Moreno, the father of Argentina's National Parks, can you tell us a bit about who he is for the sake of people who don't know? 
**MILENA:** [00:14:29.4] OK. Perito Moreno was a ... Perito means like an expert, a technician that ... He made the border between Argentina and Chile. And he came here with an expedition to do these limits, make these borders. After that he 
 [00:15:00.1] founded [established] the National Park. ... He gave to the National Park. The government tried to ... He donated. To make the first National Park. And so, well, he came from Spain. And he was an explorer. 
 [00:15:30.1] He came here but he didn't arrive to El Chaltén. He came to the area, and he had a very hard time in Río La Leona. He had to fight with the female lion. We call them pumas [Mountain lions]. 
 [00:15:58.5] So he donated his name for the river La Leona, in honor of this wild moment with the female lion.  
**Interviewer:** [00:16:39.0] Do you live here throughout the year?
**MILENA:** [00:16:39.7] All year long you mean? Yes! The winters are very lonely. I don't know why all the kids are born after winters ... You understand? You don't have many things to do ... So people are busy. At home. 
 [00:17:09.4] Yeah. All the boys are born in spring, in summer. After the winter. Nine months after the winters. 
 [00:17:29.7] Well. As busy as it is in the summer, it's as solitary in winters. 
 [00:17:47.8] Sometimes I go in my bike in winter, nobody. It's like ... We call it Death by Bike [La muerte en bicicleta]. The death is right in the bike. Because there's nobody around. 
 [00:18:08.6] I like this la muerte en bicicleta. It's very nice. 
 [00:18:15.3] You can't even find a cat around. 
 [00:18:18.4] Well, the thing is that if you love nature you can go outside anyway, you can skate in the lakes, you can skate in Capri Lake, or also there's a lake in town. Now it's a little bit dry. It's a good thing.
**Interviewer:** [00:18:47.2] How is the climate through the winter?
**MILENA:** [00:18:49.7] The whether is ... Well, this winter it was very cold. And so, it's 10 or 20 degrees below zero. 
 [00:19:13.7] So yes. I have to go to Comodoro [Rivadavia]. I had to travel a few days. And I left my home. And when I came back it was everything frozen, my plants ... Died. So yes, it can be very very cold. 
 [00:19:40.9] And many people have problems in their homes because the water tubes get frozen and so they have to repair. 
 [00:19:56.9] It also snows. This winter it snowed like it October. I remember it was like 15 centimetres. 
 [00:20:18.4] And well, you also have a social life. We meet with friends, and do music or you can go to the indoor boulder. ... 
 [00:20:37.7] There's an indoor wall. Climbing indoor, on the wall. 
**Interviewer:** [00:20:49.5] Is it really windy in winter? 
**MILENA:** [00:20:51.5] Not at all. Because it's more windy in summer. Because we have two different centres. There's in the West, a very low pressure area, and in the steppe in summer it's high pressure area. So the warm air is lighter than cold air, so the wind comes very fast and use this place. 
 [00:21:28.8] That's why ... Lost ways in the mountains because of snow, or rain, along the forest, and then goes dry and fast to the steppe. That's why it's very dry and very windy in the steppe. It's more windy in Calafate than in Chaltén. 
**Interviewer:** [00:21:49.5] Is it? 
**MILENA:** [00:21:51.1] In the steppe I mean. Well, it's also windy here. But a little bit protected by the forest. 
**Interviewer:** [00:22:02.2] It's not windy today but yesterday and the day before ... We got a taste of what it really feels like here. 
**MILENA:** [00:22:09.8] Wow. Yes. I don't remember yesterday. The day before yesterday I went to Laguna Torre, and it was very windy. 
**Interviewer:** [00:22:20.7] Someone told us it gets so windy that it can ruin houses. 
**MILENA:** [00:22:25.4] Yeah! Sure. A friend found a kayak in his yard. Oh, a kayak, OK. Now I have a kayak. Because it was blown away from some other person. And he asked everybody: I found a kayak in my yard, who is the owner? And nobody answered, so ... He has got a kayak now. ... So funny. 
 [00:23:10.1] Also you have to be very careful when you are building a house here. 
 [00:23:19.0] I have a friend that lived in a caravan. I live in a bus.  I live in a bus. Because here it's not easy to have a place to live. And so my friend, in one day I remember, in Christmas or something like that, he went out for a party and when she got back home, she found her caravan dropped. Because of the wind. 
 [00:23:51.1] So you have to tie all the time. All things. 
**Interviewer:** [00:23:59.4] Are the visitors probably surprised and annoyed by the wind?
**MILENA:** [00:24:07.9] Yes. I don't know. If you always have wind, after that you adapt. All the noises and all of these things. 
**MILENA:** [00:24:52.8] So you know about these trees. We have notofagus. These are ñires. It smells like cinnamon. 
**Interviewer:** [00:25:09.6] I love this one. 
**MILENA:** [00:25:12.0] No! Don't tear them off! You can smell them like this. 
**Interviewer:** [00:25:15.8] My wife's a landscaper and I'm used to doing this. I'm sorry. 
**MILENA:** [00:25:22.0] This is ñire. These are notofagus, the family. So we have a lot of notofagus here in Patagonia, ñire, and ... Smells like cinnamon. 
**Interviewer:** [00:25:42.5] A hundred dollar fine! I don't know but it's possible. 
**MILENA:** [00:25:44.9] Also, this is, we have from the same family lengas too. The thing is very ... Look, this is lenga, the leaf is very different than the other one. And doesn't smell like ... But it's from the same family as you saw before. 
 [00:26:17.6] This one ... No. It doesn't smell the same. This is lenga and we have also other that are guindo, or coihue, that ... These trees change the leaves' colour and loose the leaves in winter. But the others, guindo or coihue, keep the leaves in winter. Very green. 
 [00:26:52.2] And also we have the same family in New Zealand. The same trees. As notofagus. So we can say that because of that, in the beginning, the Earth was together. The Earth was Gondwana. 
 [00:27:24.2] Gondwana. I like this name. And also we have some animals, like marsupials, in Patagonia. In the North of Patagonia. Patagonia starts in Neuquén more or less, until Tierra del Fuego. 
 [00:27:50.6] So we have same animals and trees more or less. But well, this marsupial that is called "monito de monte" (little monkey of the bush) but it's not a monito. Monito means monkey. But it's kind of ... Looks like a rat. I don't think it looks like a monito. But it's very small, with big eyes, big nose, and has a pouch. 
**Interviewer:** [00:28:30.0] How big is it?
**MILENA:** [00:28:29.7] It's very small. And the tail is like this. But it's not usual to see them. I've never seen one. 
**Interviewer:** [00:28:41.4] They come out at night?
**MILENA:** [00:28:40.4] No. They live in Bariloche. ... Also near there: Villa La Angostura.
**Interviewer:** [00:29:03.7] That place is incredible!
**MILENA:** [00:29:04.8] It's in the North [of Patagonia]. It has some lakes around. There's a place that has a trail [route] that is called Siete Lagos. You can go around this trail and see all the lakes around. And so, this animals only eat a kind of flower from there. 
 [00:29:27.8] I knew that in Chile there are three different kind of marsupials. But I don't know their names. We were together with New Zealand, and then split. And the continents: it's very very similar the land. With lakes and glaciers (in NZ). 
**Interviewer:** [00:29:54.2] The land here reminds a bit of Tazmania. Yeah! 
**MILENA:** [00:30:04.5] I love this rock that you saw there. Everybody, when they see this rock standing on there on the cliff ... You know the movie? Coyote and corre caminos ... [The road runner!] 
**Interviewer:** [00:30:32.3] That one on the edge over there. Very precarious. 
**MILENA:** [00:30:34.5] Did you see? 
 [00:30:46.9] Well, these are ... We have many flowers around here. I don't know if we're going to see orchids, but we have orchids. This is a plant that we have everywhere. This is achilleas milenrama, means achilleas is from Achilles. It's a very good plant to relief your immunity and melinrama means a thousand on a branch. 
**Interviewer:** [00:31:22.7] You know a lot about the medicines of plants. 
**MILENA:** [00:31:25.5] I like. Because I use ... I do tinctures, and creams. This plant is very good for everything. 
**Interviewer:** [00:31:40.7] Another aloe vera. 
**MILENA:** [00:31:44.2] Well, that's the story, that's why it's called achillea, because he took this plant to cut the blood and they put it on the ankle. [?...] 
 [00:32:00.6] It's a very good thing for women. When in period time. 
**Interviewer:** [00:32:08.4] We have something similar for that back home. Nedal?
**MILENA:** [00:32:12.2] Maybe it's the same. 
**Interviewer:** [00:32:16.5] It looks different. So we have something different. But not sure what it's called. 
**MILENA:** [00:32:26.0] Because I know that in Europe they have the same. Maybe it's another colour but it's the same plant. Milenrama also, or achillea. Achilleas. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:18.3] Are they used to walking? 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:20.6] Yeah, quite much. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:23.2] And you? 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:24.8] I used to be a maraton runner. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:27.3] You?
**Interviewer:** [00:34:28.9] Well yeah, not professionaly, but yeah. I did the distance. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:34.1] How much? 50K?
**Interviewer:** [00:34:36.7] Marathon. That was 42K. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:38.9] Ah. With Ben we did a 50K race. 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:43.0] That's ultra. 
**MILENA:** [00:34:44.2] Ultra. Whatever. I don't know. 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:45.8] That's what I am researching. How did it go? 
**MILENA:** [00:34:49.6] Very well. I was not even prepared but since I always walk.
**Interviewer:** [00:34:54.2] Not very prepared? That's cool.
**MILENA:** [00:34:55.7] No! 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:56.9] That's my style.
**MILENA:** [00:34:58.2] I love to run, and so since I'm always running, always on the move, I always go out for a run. It's like my meditation. And that was like a year ago. Not last winter but the one before I was running everyday. I was in a sort of family crisis, and my family in general, not mine alone, and uf. I had to burn, burn karma, I don't know how to say it. 
 [00:35:34.4] And I went everyday for a run. 
**Interviewer:** [00:35:36.8] That's very clear. 
**MILENA:** [00:35:39.5] And it did me so well. Running is the best. And we ran with my brother too. So well, ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:35:52.5] Was it a season thing or do you still do that? 
**MILENA:** [00:35:54.7] What, in my family? 
**Interviewer:** [00:35:58.3] I mean about the race? The ultra? 
**MILENA:** [00:35:59.0] Ah. I did that because ... I just met Ben in USA. I went over there. I needed to do a trip alone, a different movie. And I went over there alone. And I went to climb. And I stopped at a hostel (in) California. We met there. And he invited me for a walk. So I said OK. 
 [00:36:28.1] In the beginning I resisted a bit, but then I said it was OK, let's go. And we went for a walk and we were fleeting. He was doing the Pacific route. Three months he had already been walking already. 
 [00:36:56.2] And well, we finished Lake Tahoe and right there in Lake Tahoe we got caught by a bear, a small one, but well... So that day we didn't know what to do. They invited us to sleep over at a hotel with a bunch of friends of his. We went there and then we met other people. 
 [00:37:22.9] We ended up at their homes. And all the time with new stories. And they invited us. They were going to run a marathon. And Ben said: I want in! And I got in too. So we ended up running that marathon which was awesome. And we worked as volunteers, so that we didn't have to pay. So well, the race started and I had went to the bathroom. And when I came back everyone was already running. So I began last, but well, I reached up to Ben, 
 [00:38:06.1] that was resting, and we went along and ended together the race. 
**Interviewer:** [00:38:13.1] Before this race you had never ran any race? 
**MILENA:** [00:38:17.1] Only one over here, but a small one. They're very calm. 
**Interviewer:** [00:38:21.8] A 10K? 
**MILENA:** [00:38:22.4] The ones over here were 30K. But trail, which is different. 
 [00:38:33.9] When I ran I always ran in mixed, and I came out first, I mean we came out first. But it's because it's something that I always do. Without ... I'm not even prepared. But, ...
**Interviewer:** [00:38:52.9] So you might not have a specific training ... But you do have a base training. 
**MILENA:** [00:38:52.9] Yeah, that's it. And a runner friend that runs here would tell me: no, you have to start running, and so on. And well, I was already running. But I didn't do it as a ... Like as if I wanted to win. I didn't care about that. 
 [00:39:10.8] I wanted to go and do the lap over to the Huemul in a day. So I had told Ben that we could do that. And it's, in total, 70K. So I said, well, nothing. That other trail went very well, at no time I felt breaking down or anything. It was like always, just super conscious. And (nothing), we went up walking, at a good pace, and we went down as fast as we could. But well, trying not to break anything either. 
**Interviewer:** [00:39:53.9] Very nice vibe. 
**MILENA:** [00:39:55.7] So that's it. It's like going with a certain rhythm, and over here there are so many scenes to do along a day, which I would love to do. Because I used to climb mountains. Over here. And after my son was born, I decided not to. It's a lot of risk. But I never felt that adrenaline that I felt when I went to the mountains, until I started running. 
 [00:40:25.9] So well, I said, this is something that I can do and doesn't require that I expose myself, at most I'll get some blisters. 
**Interviewer:** [00:40:37.7] Well, there are different types of races, right? Races where people go to extreme cold, or extreme heat, but in the mountain, it's ... 
**MILENA:** [00:40:45.2] Well, I'm not even interested ... I mean in those races that are eco adventures and what not. 300K ...  We can stop for a while here. So that's it. Super enthusiastic. 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:07.1] They could even make a race over here ... 
**MILENA:** [00:41:07.8] Yes. It's that they do races over here. 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:11.0] Yeah?
**MILENA:** [00:41:11.8] Yeah. The one that I mentioned. But it's ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:15.9] Oh, but I mean more distance? 
**MILENA:** [00:41:16.7] 30K. 20K by bike ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:26.1] That one that you mentioned about 70K lap was great! 
**MILENA:** [00:41:28.2] Well, and I've got a runner friend, we once came to Pampa de Las Carretas running, and he would tell me: no, boluda, you've got to enter. They wanted me to race with them. ... No! 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:44.5] Who tells you these things? If you get a good sponsor ... 
**MILENA:** [00:41:45.6] They say that they gain decent money. 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:50.3] That's why I'm saying. 
**MILENA:** [00:41:49.7] Oh whatever. ... I competed when I was little, in sport climbing. 
**Interviewer:** [00:42:01.2] In my experience, you can notice how things grow, and opportunities appear, and suddenly, as of a comparison in graffiti. Some 20 years ago it was super illegal, and the kids that have been painting the last 15 years, at least in Latin America, at first it was a sort of almost criminal activity, until they started saying: hey, this is great! 
 [00:42:38.3] And they started hiring them, and so on. Not everyone, but some. And I'm under the impression that with ultra something similar is happening. At first people did it just because, in free time. And later on, people began to win, and others would come over and offer promoting. 
**MILENA:** [00:42:55.5] If you get a brand ... I need some new pants. 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:00.0] What I mean is to stay alert to timing, because I see that these kind of things happen in USA, and it seems likely that it'll happen here too. The matter is that sometimes one can't know exactly when. 
**MILENA:** [00:43:11.1] Well, this guy that I was takling about, he's ran a lot of races. Cuatro Refugios, the Tetra. I'm awful at riding a bike. So I can run whatever you want, I don't get tired. Perhaps I'm not so fast when I start, but once I got warmed up, I can stride. But by bike I'm awful. I'd need to learn better. 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:38.4] How much do you weight? 
**MILENA:** [00:43:41.3] I don't know. ... When I'm heavy I get to 48 kilos. 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:48.9] That's the least that my wife has been. She's around 52, and she says that when she's in her worse shape is when she goes down. So 52 is like ideal. 
**MILENA:** [00:44:03.0] Does she run? 
**Interviewer:** [00:44:04.1] No, not at all. She used to play tennis. But she's in good shape, eats well, good humour, you know that stress can put some fat into you. But among runners in general it's said that the lightest, the better. 
**MILENA:** [00:44:23.0] Well, yes. The matter in my case is that I've been a climber my whole life. So to me the weight is important as well. When I'm at my thinest, is when I can climb the hardest. But I try not to get to entangled with all that. 
**Interviewer:** [00:44:45.1] Yeah, sure.
**MILENA:** [00:44:44.7] At one point I was very strict. But you go over board. 
 [00:44:59.2] Gorgeous [overhearing]. I like this word. ... So you lived up in USA until age seven? 
**Interviewer:** [00:45:03.5] Yeah. 
**MILENA:** [00:45:04.3] And that's why you're fluent... 
**Interviewer:** [00:45:07.8] Well, we are from Córdoba, I'm suspicious that my local tone moves over to English, (despite proper pronunciation)!! 
**MILENA:** [00:45:18.1] Well, I'm still learning to talk with Ben. 
**Interviewer:** [00:45:21.4] Yeah, that's the best way. That's how I teached my wife. 
 [00:45:30.0] Did you notice the stripes over there? Nice! 
**MILENA:** [00:45:44.8] Look! The mountains there: it's snowing. The forecast from Laguna de Los Tres and it's snowing there maybe. The other day when I went to Laguna de Los Tres, I remember then that I said: the snow catches us but here it didn't snow. 
 [00:46:14.2] So it's 1200 metres, Laguna de Los Tres. So it's high. 
**Interviewer:** [00:46:23.8] Mic check. Good! 
**MILENA:** [00:46:33.0] Ah look. It's a dinosaur... Look at this fossil [joking]. Cows maybe. Or a horse... 
**Interviewer:** [00:47:09.0] More of a horse than a cow... 
**MILENA:** [00:47:14.9] Yes. 
 [00:47:15.8] Anemones... Are already gone. 
**MILENA:** [00:47:44.1] Quechua is from Europe, France. 
**Interviewer:** [00:47:58.8] Quechua and Patagonia are both international brands... Hopefully they donate to local organizations ... 
**MILENA:** [00:48:15.1] Well Patagonia, the owners of the brand, he was one of the climbers that did the Californian route in Fitz Roy, in 1969. They came with other climbers, Douglas Tompkins, I don't remember the other names. 
 [00:48:39.6] And they made a movie. And also ... Look, these are geraniums. And they made a very good movie. They came like escaping from the Vietnam War, because their parents them money to move. And so they went doing surfing, in the coast of California up to Argentina. 
 [00:49:15.7] So all Peru, Chile, they were snowboarding and climbing and when they arrived here they made the first ascension of this route. The South face of Cerro Fitz Roy. The Californian route. 
**Interviewer:** [00:49:40.9] On the subject of Patagonia, do you think that ... Well, you meet a lot of international visitors, do you think that the idea of Patagonia, the image of Patagonia that Argentinians have and the one that international visitors have is similar or different? 
**MILENA:** [00:50:24.1] Oh. I think it's quite different. Because the thing is very subjective. Because all the things that you're going to see are going to be inspired or conditioned because of your life, your culture, all of your [subtleties?]... So Argentinians, we have a very different culture than International people, so
 [00:50:55.1] maybe the Argentinians think ... It's like a Patagonian dream. Everybody ... If you ask in the North of Argentina, they think that Patagonia is like a dream. Because of the mountains, the whether. And also because this big pics inspire you. 
 [00:51:23.1] When I came here my first time I was very young and the road was gravel. And the small rock was like this, very very difficult to come here. We spent three days from Bariloche to El Chaltén, because it was not very easy to drive here. And so we had to repair the wheels seven times. 
 [00:51:57.5] And the gas tank twice. We came here in a Falcon truck, very old and so, that happened. 
**Interviewer:** [00:52:10.4] What year was this?
**MILENA:** [00:52:12.1] 1999. 20 years ago. 
**Interviewer:** [00:52:18.0] So El Chaltén has changed a lot since then. 
**MILENA:** [00:52:21.5] Yeah. A lot. It was a very small town, well, it's founded in 1985. Almost 34 years old, in October it's going to be. Because well, the government decided to establish the town after a conflict with Chile. We have like a 
 [00:52:50.4] commission in the Dessert Lake, with the military and they fought each other and they killed, they shot a carabiner (Chilean), and died. So the government ... 
 [00:53:18.6] They decided to make like a place. But before that they came here many different climbers to make the mountains. So the first time that someone reached the top of Cerro Fitz Roy it was a team, a French team, in 1952. So all the expedition was very very heavy, with a lot of stuff, and a lot of food. And horses and well, all the other kind of other style.
 [00:53:54.2] And well, now climbers come that can do all the Fitz Roy range in 5 days. Like ... Two years ago, Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold they are very famous climbers in the moment, they did that, in 5 days.
**Interviewer:** [00:54:17.4] And so the town in the last 20 years. What is different about it? Can you give me some examples? 
**MILENA:** [00:54:26.0] Well, in the beginning we had few people living all year around, and so ... [Hi!] We don't have a hospital for example, we just only have like a centre. Like a healing centre. We have a school.
 [00:54:54.9] Primary school, kinder-garden and also high school. But we are just a municipality, for two years now. This change's a lot about how is the organization about the town, it's now that the decisions are from the town.  
 [00:55:22.2] Not from Río Gallegos, that is the Capital. This changed a lot. How the management ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:55:32.6] Yes. Are there many more tourist facilities? 
**MILENA:** [00:55:39.7] Well. We don't have very good signal, wi-fi signal, we don't have a bank, and so sometimes it's kind of Chaltén facilities are ... I don't know.... Also it's a good thing in one point is that you come here and you have to forget about the telephone and the communications, and so 
 [00:56:10.5] you can be like in an island. Very far away. But sometimes you need to be communicated with people and ... I don't know. 
**Interviewer:** [00:56:24.1] Are there many more visitors, are the numbers going up? 
**MILENA:** [00:56:28.2] Yes. It's rising. 
 [00:56:46.0] It's very different when I came here the first time here, it was... You could walk. I was staying in La Chocolatería, that is: you remember the bakery, in this street, and it was all the roads were gravel. Until 2008. 
 [00:57:13.4] In 2008, from this moment we have constant growth. 
**Interviewer:** [00:57:22.7] To make it more accessible then? 
**MILENA:** [00:57:24.0] Mmm. You remember we spent like 5 or 6 hours from El Calafate to arrive here to Chaltén, and now it's 2.5 hours. It was double. And spent three days to come here and when I came the first time ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:57:43.9] What year?
**MILENA:** [00:57:43.9] 20 years ago, 1999. 
**Interviewer:** [00:57:54.6] The years of Friends!
**MILENA:** [00:57:50.6] And so it was very different. 
**Interviewer:** [00:58:08.3] Are there garbage cans around here? 
**MILENA:** [00:58:11.2] No. 
**Interviewer:** [00:58:13.8] Well you know, what's funny ... That's a joke, but in some ways this place reminds me of Tazmania, but another place it reminds me of is the European Alps. But if we were in the European Alps, we'd be drinking a beer maybe there. And to get from the town to here, there'd be a chair lift. 
 [00:58:41.4] And maybe right over there a five star luxury hotel ...
**MILENA:** [00:58:44.5] Yes. The thing is that we're in the National Park. It's a problem also for us. Because we don't have a place to live. Because the National Park is just around the town and so now we are waiting for the treatment between the state, the National Park so the National Park is going to give us for the state, land to build. 
 [00:59:10.9] So I'm waiting for 11 years to have my own land, to buy. But it's ... Still waiting. 
**Interviewer:** [00:59:19.1] And don't you have illegal occupiers (ocupas)? 
**MILENA:** [00:59:20.6] Also that. But it's not very convenient... 
**Interviewer:** [00:59:25.7] What would be the pros and cons ... 
**MILENA:** [00:59:27.7] We don't have a place to live. So there's a lot of people that is using places, land, that there are nobody's living there ... Because we don't have a place. So now ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:59:44.5] So where do they live when they come over here to work? 
**MILENA:** [00:59:48.4] I live in a bus. Because I don't have a place. And I build my home. It's a very comfy place. We live for free in the bus. 
**Interviewer:** [00:59:57.5] And what about the figure, which is popular in Argentina, of usucaption (usucaptio) [usucapión]? *Paying taxes for a free land...
**MILENA:** [01:00:01.2] No. Here it's not done. 
 [01:00:05.1] Well, there are some people that are living at places from the state, and now they have the option to live there. But if you are asking for land, and after that you are occupying a space... It's not a good deal because you have to wait for a long long time, maybe the police are just going to send you some
 [01:00:33.5] like withdrawal order, [orden de retirada]...
**Interviewer:** [01:00:39.1] Does that become a conflict then between businesses and the Park? Yeah, because you only have business owners that own places but the employees have no existence. Sorry on the answer ... My bad. 
**MILENA:** [01:00:50.2] Yes. It's a very bad moment. But well, we are going to cross fingers ... Because after Chaltén became municipality, we have more options or more chances to have this option that the government is trying to hand more land from the National Park. 
 [01:01:26.6] They are in treatise to have twenty hectares from the National Park. They are doing a deal. 
**Interviewer:** [01:01:42.4] I read that a few years ago there was a ... Town at the edges, I think it was sold... Is that right? 
**MILENA:** [01:01:55.1] Yes. Andreas Madsen. 
**Interviewer:** [01:01:58.1] What was that like? 
**MILENA:** [01:01:59.9] Aaaahh. Yeah. Well, they decided to move this place. It was part of the free camping and so, many people, I lived there for a while. When I came in the first moment, when I came in my tent, I lived there for a month or so, just to visit Chaltén. 
 [01:02:32.1] And also in another moment I lived almost one season, like three months, in tent also. But in another place. Because they closed. The National Park, the rangers closed Madsen because of that. It was full of people, full of garbage also.
 [01:03:02.0] And so they are not giving us an option to live. So people live in the camping for season ... And well, you have to adapt. Anyway: if it's windy, if it's cloudy, if it's rainy, snowing, whatever. Well, that's the option. If you don't like you can go. 
 [01:03:31.5] So it's like this place there are no options for people that couldn't live. If you couldn't live here you have to move, because it's very very raw [crudo]. 
**Interviewer:**  [01:04:13.2] I mentioned usucaption. You can grab in Argentina a terrain, build a house, and start paying taxes. So even if you are not a legal owner, after a certain amount of time passes by, five or ten years of doing this ...
**MILENA:** [01:04:38.8] Ten years.
**Interviewer:** [01:04:40.4] Then you become owner of the place. 
**Interviewer:** [01:04:43.7] Squater's right. 
**Interviewer:**  [01:04:47.0] So I asked if it's possible here and she says it's not here. 
**MILENA:** [01:04:48.6] No, yes. It's possible, but you have all the town against you. That's the thing. Because you know that ... The people that are living in some places, they haven't got owners. The owner is the state. 
 [01:05:12.1] Yeah, at one point [in Spanish] I didn't have where to stay. And I put the bus in a place that the mayor told me to, and it turned out it was a neighbour's. Because he had never changed ... Never fenced. So I went and spoke to him, and told him that the mayor had told me to come over here, because I had no other place to go, and so and so. And added that I wanted to buy the land. 
 [01:05:40.4] He said: no no, stay there, since he hadn't done anything there anyway. So it's all like ... He has a house that the state provides him, and so he has where to live. They gave him a terrain and he didn't do anything. So it's better for him that I'm there. So they're not going to take him out. 
 [01:06:00.9] But to me, they haven't given me land yet. So it's like ... But it's terrible this situation. And a short time ago I went to a meeting, ... We're going to stop over this small forest. So I went to a meeting convened by the major, because the previous one was an old ... He didn't do much. 
 [01:06:27.0] His wife did his job but didn't have a formal position. And on top of that had resigned. But was the one that took the decisions. Well, he died. Now, the person that is in charge, who is much more competent, and well, we're waiting to see what happens. Because the state is swindling/compromising [transando] with Parques over some 23 hectares that are 3 kilometres away from here. 
 [01:06:55.8] Did you see where the gas station is? Over the highway, over that side, 3 K from there, there are 23 hectares. So what's going on? Parques wants Punta Banderas, which is in Calafate, in Lago Argentino, to build up a touristic side, a base camp for Parques. 
 [01:07:25.6] And so they're intending to swindle/compromise [transar] with the state. If the state gives them ... That's a done deal. 
 [01:07:35.5] We're going to stop here. 
 [01:07:40.4] So the state, [in Spanish] is giving to Parques that land in Punta Banderas, in Calafate. So Parques is giving 23 hectares, imagine that Chaltén is between 22 and 25, it's the same thing. So that's what they told us. Just wait, this is going to pass. And perhaps in the next elections ... 
 [01:08:12.4] I would like to take it off [the mic] to go take a pee. Right? 
**Interviewer:** [01:08:20.0] Could we stop for a bite here or is it too soon?  
**MILENA:** [01:08:25.3] We're close to the Pampa de Las Carretas. What time is it? It's 2:10 pm. If you want we can eat now. Whatever you prefer. 
 [01:09:28.7] Oh, [looking in backpack] my sunscreen broke. 
**Interviewer:** [01:10:15.9] Take care of not putting any glass on your face.
**MILENA:** [01:10:15.9] No no, it's OK, it's plastic. 
 [01:10:50.0] So you're a sociologist? My dad too. He did pedagogy, and then studied a masters degree on sociology. [goes on, but not audible ... Mic away]. 
 [01:19:25.0] On again [Mic in place].
 [01:19:47.3] I took it off because I went to pee. 
**Interviewer:** [01:22:13.1] Is it very steep? 
**MILENA:** [01:22:14.3] Yes!
 [01:23:12.4] Should we move on?
**Interviewer:** [01:25:35.3] Did you have a lot of celebration last night [New Year's Eve]?
**MILENA:** [01:25:36.7] My kid is sick, so we just watched a movie on Netflix: Avatar. It's great. I hadn't seen it. So we saw it in Spanish, and Ben with the translated subtitles. All the other way around. ... My little boy: I want to sleep with you guys. 
**Interviewer:** [01:27:30.0] Was I coming over in a wrong direction? That guy kind came a bit harsh...
**MILENA:** [01:27:30.0] Actually it's the one that is coming up that has priority. 
 [01:27:41.7] Ratón Pérez. It's a mouse! (Tooth Fairy). 
**Interviewer:** [01:30:20.8] How are we on the road?
**MILENA:** [01:30:20.8] We are close to Pampa de Las Carretas. There we should have a flat place and then go to ... 
**Interviewer:** [01:30:38.1] And the way back is the same, right?
**MILENA:** [01:30:38.1] Yeah! We are always going to check how we are. If we can continue or not... Because we also have, after the fork, we are going to take the trail to Loma del Pliegue and we have one hour until the place where we can decide if we continue... We'll see.
 [01:31:22.9] Also, if it's cloudy, it's going to be cloudy there anyway too. 
**Interviewer:** [01:33:04.3] Like The Lord of the Rings right?
**MILENA:** [01:33:04.3] It's a cool movie, right? [...]
 [01:34:02.6] The water master in Avatar, the series, it's about the elements. 
 [01:35:58.1] This is a chingolo. The noise ... It's a bird. A little small birdie. 
**Interviewer:** [01:37:53.5] How far is that water source? 
**MILENA:** [01:37:58.2] We have water. It's a little less than an hour. But we are going to find some streams in the way, close from here. But I prefer to go further because of the cows. 
**MILENA:** [01:40:38.3] And what are you researching? About marathons ... Oh, ultras. 
**Interviewer:** [01:40:43.7] Two main things. One, is the mental side, motivational, that people are doing this a little bit more and one thing that you mentioned was that since I've lived the same experience by my own, is that if you're in the city you get silence, and here even more, 
 [01:41:18.8] that I see that as a form of meditation. Keeping yourself emotionally, psychologically in another kind of wave, of tune, of synchronization. That's one side. And the other is about the technical side, in the sense that this trail was done in some way by somebody. And so, what are,
 [01:41:46.1] all the things that need to be done so that it's possible that people can go over here. And how is it possible to keep it going. So, for instance, you can consider Mount Fuji in Japan, maybe there's an ultra there that has 1500 or 2000 people. And then in USA, you've got Western States, and only 400 people go. So they make a lottery among I don't know how many people. 
 [01:42:10.6] And so, check out how all those mechanisms work. So if I would to isolate only two elements of research it's about the internal, individual elements of why people do it; and then, how do they do it. A leading idea that I have in mind, that goes over both, is that for anyone that's interested, and manages to do anything in ultra marathon, they have to make some kind of artisan work, 
**MILENA:** [01:42:48.6] A inner alchemy.
**Interviewer:** [01:42:48.6] Both inner and outer. If you run 50 K, with no prior training, you normally need to have ran some distance as to get to the thought that you're into it, and that you feel like having some chance to end it. I know what I'm getting into. Or I don't know in what I'm getting into but I can take the heat. 
 [01:43:07.5] And that happens both on the inner side, as in the other way, I know how the trails are, I know the dangers that I can encounter, a bear could appear, maybe everything is under control in the US, with police, people stopping in the street, or in a Park. So seeing into how every person manages to trace a certain thread. 
 [01:43:29.8] And at the same time, that happens at a certain scale. Because you've got what every person goes on into adaptation, but when a lot of people are doing the same things it's expected that there would be some common elements. So how does that work so that it happens at the scale that it is today. 
 [01:43:54.7] And each time that you speak with someone new, new questions appear. 
**MILENA:** [01:44:00.5] Nice! I believe that there's something that must happen to us on the collective subconscious, that forms a general web that awakens other antennas. ... And for me, I assume that I'm addicted to physical activity. If I don't do any physical activity I get depressed. 
**Interviewer:** [01:44:34.6] I actually suggested the opposite. I thought myself as addicted and wanted to check what happened if I left it. 
**Interviewer:** [01:44:42.7] Production issue. I'm not filming enough. Wait for me a little bit more. 
**MILENA:** [01:44:56.1] OK. 
**Interviewer:** [01:45:31.3] I understand that you climbed Mount Fitz Roy three times.
**MILENA:** [01:45:38.0] Yeah. Ben told you?
**Interviewer:** [01:45:42.2] Yeah! When was the first time? 
**MILENA:** [01:45:49.3] In 2009. 
**Interviewer:** [01:45:49.9] And what was that like? 
**MILENA:** [01:45:52.8] Incredible. It's like ... we were talking about that I have to admit that I'm a physical training addict. Well, if I don't do sports or ... I get depressed. So I already know that so I have to run or whatever. So if I'm working I'm in a very good mood. I have to do something. 
 [01:46:30.2] I started climbing very young, when I was 15 years old. Then I climbed, well it's part of my life, so after I moved to Patagonia... I moved to Bariloche and also to El Chaltén, and I started climbing mountains. 
 [01:46:54.8] But in the beginning I was climbing like rock climbing, bouldering, and small rocks. And then all of these mountains are climable but it's a hard challenge to do these mountains. You have to be very prepared. It's not only physical. Just your mind has to be very very prepared because maybe you go and you couldn't come back. 
 [01:47:27.9] So, it's kind of like maybe you've heard about that The Way of the Warrior... [El Camino del Guerrero]. So we are going like to war. Because you know, you are afraid but you have to go with your mind relaxed and knowing that maybe you'll not come back. But the state of freedom that you feel on the summits is amazing.
 [01:47:59.7] It's like well, I didn't find other similar after I started running in the mountains. And I don't know, I feel this adrenaline. Like you've made a lot of effort, and you feel with your mind clear and with a lot of oxygen. And so I feel very happy too. To find these things that you are running and you are just seeing all the landscapes and well, now I'm motivated to run on the mountains. 
 [01:48:38.7] And not taking many risks as is when you are climbing. Because climbing is very dangerous. I mean the alpine climbing. You have many moments that you don't know what is going to happen. Because sometimes rocks fall and sometimes you have to cross ... 
 [01:49:09.5] a glacier, and there are many many crevices. Or the snow, the avalanche, whatever. Or the storm can happen in a rash. And also, sometimes the wind can carry you to the top. This is very dangerous because the ropes can twist and you can have a problem. 
 [01:49:41.0] It's a very good thing if you can do it, it's very very nice. Life is ... You're going to choose other ways, so ... 
**Interviewer:** [01:49:56.5] How many times have you climbed Fitz Roy? 
**MILENA:** [01:50:00.1] I climbed three times. I reached the summit and I made also a fourth time but we didn't reach the summit because we were in a bad storm. We arrived almost to the summit and it was very very windy and the ropes go like this [showing] and so we ... It was a very stressful moment. Many rocks fell, and so we were like just dodging rocks and so we spent one night there,
 [01:50:39.3] and the other day we decided to come down. So in the way down we saw the Californian route and so there we decided that the next time we'd use the Californian route. And this is my last time that I went to Fitz Roy.
**Interviewer:** [01:51:00.1] What year? 
**MILENA:** [01:51:02.2] In 2011. And after that I got pregnant. 
**MILENA:** [01:51:09.4] I guess that something, my body, my nature, my biology says: OK, you have to stay here. I'm here. 
**Interviewer:** [01:51:22.8] Where else have you climbed in the world? 
**MILENA:** [01:51:27.9] I was climbing in Spain, Peru, Chile, and also in the States. But in the States some in the Washington Colon [?]. And the Third Pillar of Ghana [?], in Yosemite Valley. And well, not very ... 
 [01:51:56.7] The mountains are not like this. Like here you have many risks, because you are going in glaciers, some crevices, more conditions ... You are playing in a ... All the time you have to take decisions, if you're crossed, if you have to ... In the glacier, 
 [01:52:27.5] Everything is not about when you are climbing. Sometimes it's when you are going down. A lot of the accidents happen when you are going down, because you're more tired and so, also other things can happen. Like [x], well, people die in the mountains. 
 [01:52:57.3] I don't want to become melodramatic. But well, 
**Interviewer:** [01:53:01.9] You're laughing, so that's nice. 
**Interviewer:** [01:53:04.1] Thanks you sharing that. 
**Interviewer:** [01:53:06.2] So how common is it for people, for tourist coming over here, do half of them rock climb, and half of them track? Or what is the common activity for most tourists?
**MILENA:** [01:53:18.8] Well, many alpine climbers come here for climbing the mountains. So this town is new, among climbers, because people came over here. The Italians came here, the French came here. In 1937 a group of Italians came and they made the first attempt to Fitz Roy and they made the Italian opening [Brecha de los italianos]. 
 [01:53:50.4] If we see Fitz Roy I'll show you in the picture. They made like an ice channel. They made like four, five pitches. And they arrived there but they couldn't reach the top. They had to go back. And after that in 1952 came back a French team, Lionel Terray and Guido Magnone, and they reached the summit. They were very very brave men. 
**Interviewer:** [01:54:24.3] That's the name of the street that I told you about. 
**MILENA:** [01:54:35.1] They came here and spent months. And they were only with a rope like this and pitons with pitons with pitons and ... 
 [01:54:47.4] When I went for my first time to Fitz Roy, I went to the Supercanaleta and non-stop style. So we started the day at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon from Eléctrico River and this day we just walked until the base, and we climbed all night long the Superchannel, without rope, 
 [01:55:14.7] with ice sacks [?], and after that we just started climbing with the rope on the rock. It's 1000 metres more, and it was ... Takes from the bottom to the top, and the bottom again, 26 hours, all day climbing. And we didn't sleep. We just had one rope, and one pizza portion, one apple and one alfajor. 
 [01:55:46.7] And water, a little. No sleeping bags. A crazy moment, and so when we reached the summit in the day, we went down, rappelled down, and when we were walking on the glacier I remember that I was hallucinating just dreaming awake. 
**Interviewer:** [01:56:14.1] Dehydrated...
**MILENA:** [01:56:17.7] Well. Also we didn't sleep for I don't 40 something hours. And so when we arrived to the base camp we made a soup, and we used others' sleeping bags because there were no people there, so we stole the sleeping bags for a while. We slept a little and then we went back to Chaltén. 
 [01:56:40.3] We went back to Chaltén and so ... It was like: well, I was there. When we were there on the top: Oh, we are wishing to there, and then Chaltén is there, so ... We wished to go there, to Chaltén. It was amazing. Because, well, humans, we are like this. Always we are trying to go for the carrot that is in our front, not here. 
 [01:57:07.2] So I'm trying now to enjoy the moment. Not following the carrot. Just enjoy life. 
**Interviewer:** [01:57:18.8] That's something that I use in my work. That we're always following a carrot. 
**Interviewer:** [01:57:34.1] You're incredible. Thanks for sharing that. 
**MILENA:** [01:57:38.9] I feel sometimes that I don't like to tell people that I climbed Fitz Roy because I'm a little bit shy. But well ... It's like ... I feel like it's my other life. After I became a mom I don't want to take some risks. It's very very different now for me. 
**Interviewer:** [01:58:09.8] Me do become a little more conscious about how we spend our time. 
**MILENA:** [01:58:17.4] And also this, that I told you at the last, to enjoy life like the simple things. Just to have ... Play with my son, or just drink some mate and go outside for a simple walk. But I feel like, in my veins, I need activity. I notice about that so I try to be more calm, and maybe 
 [01:58:55.4] I run in the forest, and gives me calm. And so ... yeah. It's a balance. Don't be crazy, don't be ... very very quiet. I couldn't do that. 
 [01:59:20.0] So we started studying yoga teacher. To be more ...  
 [01:59:39.8] We met with Ben in Yosemite, ... No. In Bishop, in hostel California. And so we went for a trekking around. He was doing the PCT [Pacific Crest Trail]. 
 [02:00:09.2] So he was doing this. And we met there and we went for ... I shared with him a little part of the trail and so we met with a bear at a moment. So we decided to just not continue. And so we met with some guys 
 [02:00:34.7] that they invited us to their house. So we were sharing with this guys in Lake Tahoe, and they invited us to a marathon. Like an ultra marathon. And so we went. It was very cool. 
 [02:01:10.3] A very good thing. The carrot! It's a good metaphor. 
 [02:01:27.6] I remember when I was there in the Fitz Roy summit, I wanted to stay at home. Like warm. And why do we do that? It's like: we're so stupid, the humans sometimes. Trying to push ourselves like: reach the summit! And then when you're on the summit you want to stay at home.
 [02:01:55.7] It's funny. 
 [02:02:03.4] Three years ago a really good friend, like my bro, like my brother, died in Fitz Roy. 
**Interviewer:** [02:02:11.7] I'm sorry.
**MILENA:** [02:02:11.5] Yes. He was very young. And he was always like laughing and smiling, and when people asked him: why are you going to Fitz Roy .. You know that you can die there. ... Well, I'll do it before I die. And so we have some good phrases from him. 
 [02:02:37.0] After that it's also like a slam ... No. Like a slap in the face. 
 [02:02:55.0] Because also, we were climbing one week before that. Cerro Solo. 
 [02:03:04.2] Look from here. This is Pampa de Las Carretas. This is the place that I told you. In a few, we're going to find the fork. To go to the ... This is Loma del Pliegue Tumbado. The hill. 
 [02:03:31.2] There is like a rounded ... But in the right you have a more clear hill. We're going there. The one on the right. 
**Interviewer:** [02:03:49.6] You were saying that before your friend passed away, you were climbing there the week before... 
**MILENA:** [02:03:50.9] Yes. We went to Mermoz. It was a very good climbing. But I noticed that my head changed. A lot. Because it was my first climbing after I'd became a mother. And so I was like: oh, like all the time looking around, and I don't want to walk like this ... I was watching around.
