Hi Lisa! I am publishing a book from Spanish, already published, and now translated to English: 33,000 words, by several authors. It's for an NGO (Green Drinks) that works on sustainable topics. 

In case you'd be interested: 
How much would you charge to proof-read that material? 

Perhaps if this is not your cup of tea, you may be kind to point me out someone else that might be interested?
Many thanks in advance.
Best wishes from Córdoba, Argentina.
Benjamín Juárez.

PS. I found your profile through Linkedin and looked like a very good option. Thanks again!

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks so much for getting in touch about your book. I'm not the right fit for your project, but I can recommend several other avenues you can pursue. You need someone who specializes in nonfiction. Search for an editor via the directory of the Editorial Freelancers Association. You can also place a help wanted ad through the EFA they'll send out for interested parties to reply to.

Best regards,

Lisa Poisso
