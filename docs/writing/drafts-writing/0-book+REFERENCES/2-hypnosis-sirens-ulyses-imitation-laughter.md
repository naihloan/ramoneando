# Ulyses Sirens, the Joy of Being Inside a Loop, and What to do Next

I am Ulyses. And I can just wonder how enjoyable it is to listen to the sirens.
I am mesmerized by a sweet chant. I am inside a family life that surpasses all: I dreamt of it, even had
visualizations stronger than deja vus. This is more. Even the children are more real like than I
could anticipate. I couldn't even imagine this all in my most flowering imaginations.

It's been a long time inside the loop. And even if it's hard to get out I can still
notice the repetiton I am under. How can I tell that I am repeating myself? Well, I cannot account much
accomplishments outside of this life. It is as if I had placed everything on pause.
Of course we are filled with great moments. Even under imitation.

My wife salutes me in a very candid way: she gives a somewhat private but gentle style
smooth hand strike to my lower lower "lower back". It is an intimate salute that is
very loving, not promising nor unpromising any further moves later in the night.
This singular motion says hi, or more, depending on interpretation.

I was doing a normal ordinary thing at the moment of salute: heating milk for my 14 months daughter.
Standing near the oven I was already cooling down the drink. My back is facing both
Andy and baby Justi. Who turns out to not be such a baby, noticing every single
motion that we make, as follows.

The small creature was tired and with some hunger for that upcoming preparation.
At least that what I can fathom is happening by the late hours.
The baby lets me know I should hurry up and pay attention, or God knows
what she wanted to communicate, or if what happened next was rather a simple copy
and paste action.

The baby striked me a slap in my shoulder.

I have never felt from her any hard tiny hands along the first year and two months. Immediately after the hit we, the two adults, just looked at our selves in surprise and joy.
