**Stop acting like you know. **Taxi drivers and bartenders are your
consiglieres, your guides. Don’t tell them where you want to go; ask
them to point you where you should be. This also applies at restaurants.
I gave up menus and entries years ago. Make snacks your friends and
simply ask the experts (i.e. people who work there) what you should be
eating. If you already know what you want, then you really didn’t need
to leave home in the first place.

2\. **Tap your friends (and friends of friends) for advice.** Ask people
what you should go see. I found all the highlights of this road trip by
following suggestions from locals (some of them strangers, but now
friends).Avoid highways: stick to the small roads to soak up real
flavour while you travel.

3\. **Take care of the people who help you.** Everyone at the hotel gets
a tip except for the people who make sure your sheets are clean and your
bed is made? Common. Leave a few bucks with a note attached to thank the
maids, the most under-appreciated (and most important) people there.

4\. **Be British.** I never thought I’d say that, but one thing the Brits
do well is self-deprecation. Be fully prepared to make fun of yourself,
or your home town. There’s nothing worse than a traveller who’s deadest
on convincing everyone that they’re not a stereotype.

5\. **If you’re a sports fan, watch (and cheer) from your hotel room.**
Nice as most people might be, there is a line. And it usually involves
the score.

6\. **Stay away from Interstates if you can. **A city’s charms lie miles
from the fast roads.

7\. **Take chances with conversations.** Oh sure, we can be reserved back
home, but sitting down and talking to people on either side of you makes
for a more authentic experience… or that might be the Okie in me
talking.

8\. **Write postcards, not emails. **Let’s bring back the images that got
us wander lusting in the first place. And speaking of bringing things
back, how about classing it up again on airlines? I’m the biggest
offender of this rule, refusing to travel in anything but my worn-out
yoga pants, but still. Let’s bring style back to travel.

9\. **Take people up on their offers.**When someone invites you over to
their house, or out to dinner, or on a tour — take them up on it (but be
safe). Heartfelt generosity is the reason I’ve been able to travel so
long on so little money. People love The Golden Rule of Guesting: bring
your host a gift (books work well).

10\. **Follow the Golden Rules of Guesting**: leave a room/house in
better shape than when you got there and never ever show up at a host’s
place empty handed. I usually take 4-5 copies of
[my](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(novel) "Wikipedia entry for High Fidelity ")favorite[book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(novel) "Wikipedia entry for High Fidelity ")
for these occasions (if you follow my [10 rules of
packing](http://intelligenttravel.nationalgeographic.com/2012/02/24/the-10-rules-of-packing/ "Intelligent Travel - 10 Rules of Packing by Aric S. Queen"),
you should have plenty of room); ink on paper lasts a lot longer than
the predictable bottle of wine will.

Let me introduce myself: My name's Zozor. I was born on 23 November
2005. A bit meager, is it not? This is why I've now decided to write my
biography to let my readers know who i really am.
