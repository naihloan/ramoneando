\enquote{Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents}, grumbled Jo, 
lying on the rug.

\enquote{It's so dreadful to be poor!} sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress. \dots

Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,---

\enquote{You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents 
 this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one} \dots.

\enquote{I agreed not to expect anything from mother or you, 
but I do want to buy \WorkTitle{Undine and Sintram} for myself; 
I've wanted it \emph{so} long}, said Jo, who was a bookworm.
