**MILENA:**  [00:04.5] The way down is easier. 
 [01:15.6] I think that wild can be very very very ... Deep. A deep word. I can feel like my soul. It's very wild. Because I feel like my instincts as I'm a woman. I feel all the sensations very ... In my skin. 
 [01:46.0] I feel very connected with nature because we are connected with the moon and with the cycles. And I also feel like I am free. And I always try to follow my feelings, my instinct. So, to be like 
 [02:15.5] this kind of world. If I feel like my soul is wild, and also I can say other things about nature. About where I am living. In a wild place, that you can touch the wilderness very close from where you live. 
 [02:39.1] And so, this kind of life is very wild. 

**MILENA:**  [02:54.4] Yes. We are in a wild place. Not very very touched by men, by humans I mean. So as soon you go further, it's more wild. Because you don't have ... Very ... It's not very accessible. By cars, or other things. 
 [03:32.5] It's also because this place is wilder than other places for climbing because you don't have many exits. If you go for climbing, you have to go back the same way. Nobody is going to just rescue you like an a helicopter. 
 [03:58.7] We don't have any helicopter. 
**Interviewer:** [04:02.0] You don't!? You have to walk back? [Laughters]
**MILENA:**  [04:02.8] No. Yes! I mean. When some wrongs happen, sometimes we can ask for the military's helicopter, but we don't own a helicopter. 
 [04:26.5] And so, this is the different thing with the Alps, or I don't know, the other mountains in the world. Because they have more accessibility to rescue people. And here the rescue team is voluntary and also, when something happens, we have to go by foot. 
 [04:52.5] Or sometimes, if we are lucky, we can find the helicopter from the military, or sometimes ... Well, from Chile. Whatever. But we have to ask. I don't know if I answered the question.
