**Interviewer:**  [01:18.2] Would you like to begin by introducing yourself? What is your name, where are we, and where are we going today? 
**Rodrigo:** [01:39.3] My name is Rodrigo. We are in Chaltén. We are going to Lago del Desierto. I am from Chaltén. 

**Interviewer:**  [02:24.6] He's not here, no need to look at the camera. Have you always lived here? Did you come from elsewhere? A personal biography. Which were the reasons why you reached here. 
 [03:33.5] He understands everything, so don't mind about translations. And upon where to look, you can speak naturally to me. I want to know myself. 
**Rodrigo:** [03:49.2] I've been living in Chaltén for some years. I am from over here, down South. I am a biologist, by profession. And I am a environmental interpretation guide. Now we are going through the road from Chaltén and we'll be making several stops to tell you about the interpretation of the place and show you about the biodiversity and the place's geological history. 
**Interviewer:** [04:22.6] How did you study biology and what attracted you over here?
**Rodrigo:** [04:26.8] I started because my father worked his whole life in a fauna area at state level, and from my youngest years I would go along with him to work and I liked it naturally and just out of affinity I chose that path. I like to be outdoors, and I am curious. That's mainly what thrusted me towards the profession. 
**Interviewer:** [05:03.8] In the biological sense, is there some kind of magnet that brought you over up to here?
**Rodrigo:** [05:08.1] Yes. Many. The nice thing about being over the mountain side [Cordillera] is that in this place that is so South, is that it's like a small island of biodiversity of what we have in Southern Patagonia. It has always been understood that this area is a place with no life. This is not very accurate, but if you compare with other places more North, perhaps it is more poor.  
 [05:50.3] So this island in the mountain is a sort of oasis, with attractive points relating to the the environmental and geological history of the area. 
**Interviewer:**  [06:19.6] Why did we stop here?
**Rodrigo:** [06:20.3] Due to the geological history we can see things that are not apparent. 32 Million years ago all of this was covered by sea. Before this place existed, this was all covered. Later on the mountain grew, because of the crash between tectonic plates. 
 [06:59.6] And with the range's growth the sea began to recede. The range exposed it's history and here are hints that this was sea. This is a [showing] mould, not a fossil, of an extinct animal, a mollusc: an amonites. They're animals that existed when the area was sea. And this is the sediment in the sea.  
 [07:43.3] Even if it's a very small dent, it's very old. 
**Interviewer:**  [07:55.0] Does that suffer erosion?
**Rodrigo:** [07:56.3] No. That remains. It does have some erosion with a lot of wind and water, but it's a sedimentary rock that is quite solid. The matter to consider is the human influence, machines. We've identified some but once in a while they disappear, or another one appears. 
 [08:17.3] A lot of times, when people know that they exist it's like a trophy that they want to take home. It's quite common that they take them away. In fact, in places where it's known that there are a lot, people go and take them and put them on their own sidewalks. There are sidewalks with amonites. And yes, it's quite good eye candy but the nicest things is that they remain in place and see them under the real situation of the area, and imagine what this used to be. 
 [08:50.6] That makes it prettier, more fun, more natural. But well, we are human and we always poke our fingers in wherever we want.
**Interviewer:**  [09:00.1] Mano en la lata, Mano en la naturaleza. [Yes. Chuckles.]

**Rodrigo:** [09:37.7] Now we are going to access a viewpoint over the Laguna Condor. 

**Rodrigo:** [14:36.5] This is Laguna Condor. It's a river's corner (curve). It's a shallow. 
**Interviewer:**  [14:57.9] This view is amazing. 
**Rodrigo:** [15:03.7] This lagoon is very used by birds. Aquatic birds. They come over here to nest. And migrating birds that migrate from the range to the steppe, or the other way around. 
**Interviewer:**  [15:36.0] Is that a wild horse?
**Rodrigo:** [15:36.7] No. There are estancias, and there are cows as well. They are ... 
**Interviewer:**  [15:58.3] So pretty!!
**Rodrigo:** [16:01.8] Just a moment.

**Interviewer:** [17:35.4] OK, Toby, this is for you, I just said to the camera as I was filming. She is the one logging the video, so every single clip that we shoot, she catalogues, and she loves horses. So she'll be happy to log this one. We'll know it's horse, in Argentina, in Patagonia. Otherwise it takes a long time to find footage among the files. 
 [18:47.7] We're doing two documentaries. Feature film and an interactive documentary. Jules is the programmer. 

**Rodrigo:** [19:31.2] Black neck swans [cisne de cuello negro]. It's Río de Las Vueltas. And this is Laguna Cóndor. Which is a an overflow (reflow, dam) of the same river. 

**Interviewer:** [21:16.6] Is the black necked swan endemic here? Only from here?
**Rodrigo:** [21:25.4] No. They are from here South. They have quite a wide distribution in Argentina. But in these areas they migrate. In summer they come to the range area, such as flamencos, and when it gets cold they go to steppe lagoons. More North, but mostly to the steppe all the time. 
 [22:07.0] And horses, like the one we just saw, are in some places, as cows. And they are one of the biggest problems in matters of conservation of natural spaces. They have feet and bodies that are very big for the forest regeneration system. 
 [22:37.9] In those places where there are a lot of cows, or a lot of horses: the renewable in trees don't prosper. There's a great mortality for small trees and other plants. 

**Rodrigo:** [23:40.4] All this area goes down. Here we call this environment maginen, a wetland. Most of the trees that you can see in the low are of the ñire species. 

**Interviewer:**  [24:21.3] Is this a bird sanctuary? 
**Rodrigo:** [24:56.7] Yes. It's a good place. There's a lot of refugee sites for birds. There's forest, water, food. Which is what's missing in other places in the South, in the steppe mostly. Where the terrain is very wide open. 
 [25:19.9] Can you notice in the lagoon, there's movement, there are fish. From the 1900s they began to bring fishes from North America and Europe to seed different watery bodies into Patagonia. Nowadays, all continental watery bodies in Patagonia have species from the salmon families: trucha arco iris, trucha marrón, salmón chinoc. 

**Interviewer:**  [26:39.0] This is a reserve but it's administered by the province of Santa Cruz. Did he say that in camera? Let's ask later. Car vibrations can create distortion in the recording. 

**Rodrigo:** [27:53.6] One feature of this whole area, which is a provincial reserve, is that it's lacking a lot of work on the natural area. Much research is needed on the behaviour of exotic species, work on controlling, there's no strict control as of Parques, which they do. 
 [28:27.4] It was only last year that a plan to control the area was made. It's a comprehensive document which evaluates the natural resources and plans the managing for all activities. 

**Interviewer:** [29:25.9] The road, you've noticed, that is sometimes under worse conditions? And they recondition it once in a while? 
**Rodrigo:** [29:30.0] Yes. The boulder passed this season quite a bit. Other seasons it's very uncomfortable to pass through.

**Interviewer:**  [29:44.6] How often?
**Rodrigo:** [29:49.4] Every two weeks. But other years they could do it just twice overall in a season. And it was one hole after another. By car, in a small one, you can't ... You take too much time. Or you totally break it. 

**Interviewer:**  [32:06.6] Does the road go all the way to Chile?
**Rodrigo:** [32:14.7] No. It ends in Laguna del Desierto. In Laguna del Desierto you can go over by boat or walking. There's a trekking, at the North side of Lago del Desierto, towards Chile. And then you need to catch a boat and just then you reach Villa O'Higgins, Chile. So you arrive by foot. Because the limit is before arriving by boat. 
**Interviewer:**  [32:51.2] So from the further part of the lake you can actually walk to Chile. It's a hike for sure.
**Rodrigo:** [33:00.1] Did you notice that there's a lot of bikes that go through here? With baggage. It's that they make the connection between Chaltén and Carretera Austral, through Lago del Desierto.  
[stopping by malfunction, noises] [never happened before, something electronic should've happened] [battery's OK] [checking manual]
 [44:09.3] The fuel channel has been blocked ... Lights are OK.
[48:37.2] [alarm related problem]

**Interviewer:**  [50:53.0] Should we ask for a lift by phone?
**Rodrigo:** [50:54.5] There's no signal.
