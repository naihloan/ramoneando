+ If you do follow your [bliss](/wiki/Bliss "Bliss") you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there [all](/wiki/All "All"){.mw-redirect} the while, waiting for you, and the [life](/wiki/Life "Life") that you ought to be living is the one you are living.
+ It has always been the prime function of [mythology](/wiki/Mythology "Mythology") and rite to supply the symbols that carry the [human](/wiki/Human "Human"){.mw-redirect} [spirit](/wiki/Spirit "Spirit") forward, in counteraction to those that tend to tie it back.
+ The achievement of the [hero](/wiki/Hero "Hero"){.mw-redirect} is one that he is ready for and it's really a manifestation of his character. 
+ [Eternity](/wiki/Eternity "Eternity") has nothing to do with [time](/wiki/Time "Time"). Eternity is that dimension of [here and now](/wiki/Present "Present") which thinking and time cuts out. This is it. And if you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere. And the [experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") of eternity right here and now is the function of [life](/wiki/Life "Life"). 
+ I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonance within our own innermost being and [reality](/wiki/Reality "Reality"), so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive. That's what it's all finally about.
+ I think it's important to live [life](/wiki/Life "Life") with a [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") of its [mystery](/wiki/Mystery "Mystery"), and of your own mystery.
