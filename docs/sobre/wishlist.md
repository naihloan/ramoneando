Monte Fitz Roy. [Serac
Expediciones](https://www.interpatagonia.com/elchalten/contemplacion-cerro-fitz-roy.html).

CHECK Technical requirements for trekking to [Fitz
Roy](http://www.serac.com.ar/espanol/trekking/tk2_trekking_el_chalten_patagonia_argentina.php).

Important notes about access to different daily trips. Mainly that we
will have to plan how to carry the equipment because we will not be able
to reach all destinations by car, we would need 4x4 truck or alike which
can be provided by guides. In case that we go only by our car, then the
distances to reach each place extend further than what would be
reasonable to walk, some 24 kms (nearly 15 miles) total in some cases.
Some options surrounding Mont Fitz Roy:

1.  **To Monte Fitz Roy, through Laguna de Los Tres**
    17 kms by road. Then walk 12 kms towards destination (then come back
    12 kms again). This path has a strong inclination so is expected to
    be hard. Also we can go back through another trail to capture
    different views.
2.  **Laguna Torre**
    Also 12 kms to walk, and back. Less vertical demanding than
    previous.
3.  **Intermediate options**
    Only 4/6 kms for both previous destinations.
4.  **Out of town options: Reservas Los Huemules + Lago del Desierto**
    At 20K and 37K from town: very interesting and picturesque places to
    film. Nota bene: The roads here are made of gravel.
5.  **Price: 210 dollars a day for a group of our 4 persons.**
6.  **My Comment**
    Perhaps best options because practical/viable are the Intermediate
    and One of the Out of town.

Glaciar Vespigniani. Mountain trekking through unexplored area.
[Gigantes
Patagones](http://gigantespatagones.com.ar/lago-del-desierto-glaciar-vespignani/).

<reservas@gigantespatagones.com.ar>. Wrote email to Thelma. &gt;&gt;
Necesitar√≠a los datos de todos, y el hotel donde estar√°n en Chalten. Por
otra parte, necesitan traslado de Calafate a Chalten? Luego, para
terminar de confirmar la reserva deben realizar el pago.

Offer by the company as follows.

-   We can stay more time at the reservation. For instance, depart at
    morning in the boat that goes to the two Glaciars \[Vespigniani +
    Viedma\], arriving at 1020 am to the reservation and then that the
    boat picks us up at 0130 pm, which would give us nearly 3 hours in
    the place. This would have a net cost of 2250 Argentinean pesos per
    person.
-   As for transport, we can go by private transport up to Lago del
    Desierto, or in a regular service (verbatim ¬ø?). The costs are 850
    Argentinean pesos: going out at 8 am and coming back at 7/8 pm. Once
    back from the reservation we could still use nearly an hour at Lago
    del Desierto, so we can go up to Glaciar Huemul and stay there.
-   Private transport is 1680 Argentinean pesos, going out at 8 am, and
    coming back when ready.

Glaciar Viedma. "Less touristic". 3 full hours of Ice Trekk.

La Leona. Ex-Estaci√≥n Astron√≥mica Austral. This may be seriously
outdated, since all astronomy these days is in Bariloche. But still may
have some useful information on the science and society of the area.

A small *occupied* space. This means standing in a territory, be it a
home/building, or a piece of land. We would need to check distance from
where we are. \* Note: *Ocupa* de bigotes in Chalt√©n, ask Rolo de Torres
del Paine). I followed up with my contact Gustavo but he could not get
the contact now. UPDATE: Got contact. Called (no answer) and wrote to
him 2018-12-04. He has a tourism agency called [Lago San
Mart√≠n](http://www.lagosanmartin.com/). Got Rolo's Contact: Alejandro

[La Waffler√≠a](https://www.rivendelchalten.com/la-waffleria/) / Waffle
House. Waffles have not been historically a thing in Argentina. In some
cool and touristic places they have been developing for the last two
decades. May show some idea of international tourism. Since house is in
English there might be a chance that they speak in English. Contacted
November 14: wrote email. They replied by email on November 16 offering
reservation to the hotel. I should call back.

Camila & Luciano. I went to an all-outdoor store where I live to pick up
my number for a running race in the mountains. There I found a magazine,
from which I searched their website and found some guides in our
research area. [Kooch Online

    \[Calafate\] Contacted November 16: wrote by cell phone. My cousin
    gave a manager's course in October and gave me the contact. They
    have a company that works providing services to tourists: guides,
    excursions, etc. As a second point, they are [*representatives of
    the regional
    companies*](http://www.elcalafate.tur.ar/listado-de-agencias/item/140-glaciers-land.html)
    that do the same kind of service, hence they can contact us with
    people in Chalt√©n as well. We interchanged audio messages. Gisela
    told me that she could gather up some ideas and would give more info
    on what she can offer. Contacted again through msg
    2018-12-06. &gt;&gt; **Mariela** gave details and sent back for
    reservation to Gisela: reservas@glaciersland.com Sent email
    2018-12-11 asking how to reserve. Actually, her husband **Rub√©n** is
    part of the Regional Representation of Calafate, and will help
    contact with National Park Manager.

-   [Estancia el Condor](https://www.estanciaelcondor.com/#4). Gustavo
    recommends to take *estancias* into account. In the area, lonely
    planet recommends this one, 5 hours away from Chalt√©n. Perhaps too
    far away, but still thinkable for a day trip if it would be worthy.
-   Maybe get a local artisan to weight in for more variety in
    socio-economic diversity. People working on sidewalks are very
    common in Argentina. Would be good to notice if the cold of South
    Weather leaves them out or if the affluence of tourism gives
    opportunity for temporal jobs. Perhaps consider [Urban
    Hitchhiking](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/30281)?
    Maybe too far fetched.

### Calafate and around

10. Glaciar Perito Moreno. Boat. First item of the list, this is
    something that everyone that heads this way does, at any age. See
    the Glaciar, maybe have a whiskey on the rocks of the Glaciar, and
    back. The normal tour can be between an hour or up to 7.
11. [MarPatag: Experiencia Glaciares
    Gourmet](https://www.patagoniachic.com/descargas/catalogo-de-excursiones-2017-2018.pdf).
    This is a whole day visit to two Glaciars: Upsala (one of the
    biggest) and Spegazzini (highest). High social profile and Gourmet
    Cuisine. **Contacted.** Demands Payment to Reserve. I
    [e-mailed](https://www.patagoniachic.com/patagonia-chic-excursiones-contacto.php)anyway
    by November 14th.
12. Glaciar Perito Moreno. Hiking on the Glaciar. This seems a must for
    anyone who can. Perhaps it may be overpriced, and not the real
    thing. But it is worth to know more about it. Perhaps it is somewhat
    alike to bush-walking through a pathway.
13. Balcones de Calafate. Promising sight-seeing, high and apart from
    the lake and main Glaciar.
14. Coqui Aristiz√°bal. Music Studio Producer at Sala Siranush. I read
    about a discographic that makes albums on a musician's biography:
    Diego Frenkel who wrote *A trav√©s de las canciones* \[ocassional
    co-artist with David Byrne\]. The local producer should be
    available, a plus could be having the chance to interact with
    musicians. Why do they come all the way up to here? Does the
    environment help? Is this studio better than American ones, where
    they could also choose as equally valid (and frequent) options?
15. Elsa Rodr√≠guez. Contact that my informant friend Gustavo Giorgis
    gave me. She should be a good link for other contacts. los horarios
    que tendr√≠a libres para hablar:
    -   De lunes a sabado &gt; Al mediod√≠a entre 14 y 15 hs
    -   Los domingos &gt; A la noche, despu√©s de las 23 √≥ 24 hs
16. Puerto Natale Internacional. Third world destiny related to
    trekking, as of Gustavo's recommendation. Too far away!! And on
    Chile side.
17. ~~Dorte Beldal? Foreigner married to a local. Has a
    [website](http://rasmussentravel.dk/about-us/). wrote email 13
    nov &gt; Fully **Booked** 2019~~
18. Cerro Fr√≠as. This is not part of the Andes, hence it gives an
    important view of the rest. Also, the way through goes by a white
    oak forrest with local flora and fauna.
19. Safari Picture Tour / Estancia 25 de Mayo. Bird/Fauna watching:
    guanacos, condors, foxes; old marine fossils, first nations (-10000
    years). Can be very unpromising (a cheap sell), but good to have a
    wide scope of what the local offer is.
20. Campo Municipal de Doma y Folklore. This place, as a state
    institution does not make much sense in being here down south, that
    is what makes it interesting, and likely out dated.
21. [Centro de Interpretaci√≥n Hist√≥rica
    \[Archives\]](https://www.interpatagonia.com/elcalafate/centro-interpretacion-historica.html).
    This may come with some surprise from the origins of the discovery.
    Perhaps may serve as contrast with today. Also expectable to find
    visual material. **Contacted** November 22: wrote email. Called
    2018-12-06 [+54 2902-492799](+54%202902-492799). Person in charge:
    Luis Callejas (Not available on the day of call). Auto-guided tour,
    5 saloons, Pre-History + Originary Populations.
22. [Glaciurium](http://glaciarium.com/es/contacto/). Some of the above
    natural things + *Gift Shop*. To add a little more of the commercial
    aspect. **Contacted.** November 22: wrote email. 2018-12-06: Called
    and spoke with Maira. Sent email again with consent attached.
23. [Glaciar Sur / Hike + Asado](http://www.glaciarsur.com/).
    Asado/Barbeque: traditional and real regular national meal, perhaps
    because of culinar importance this item could be much higher in the
    list. **Contacted** November 14: wrote email. Got candid response by
    Dafne Moreno.
24. R√≠o Turbio, miner town, now in conflict. A great chance if possible
    to travel up to the place. 3 hour drive.
