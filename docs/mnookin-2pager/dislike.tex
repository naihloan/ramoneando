 \item[Telling others to do things, pushing.]
I don't want to work in a place where goals are not aligned between teams. %which makes it hard to collaborate.
I want to work in a place where peers are motivated and onboarded with
%the goals and
strategy.
I need improvement: a PM role can entail
mentoring and coaching others. %to achieve their goals too.
 %  I seek collaboration, not to be my teammates' boss.
 \item[Overworking.] Except one sprint at night or weekend once a quarter, or once a year.
 Not a given.
 \item[Useless meetings.] Goal: <2 per day,  <5/6 per week. %  No unlimited meeting invites please.
 \item[Reporting.]
%  Stakeholders need to
 I communicate progress, %with focus on
 and delivering value. %, %not presentation.
 Else can become micro-management.
  \item[Bureaucracy.] Good PMs negotiate well.
  % good at handling several stakeholders %can have good outcomes or bad ones % depends on many factors, including company direction:
  But stakeholders overstepping hurts the building process.
% % % % % % % % % % % %
%  I dislike delaying results and delivery:
%  It's OK to chill
%  but  make the product grow, deliver value, on time;
%  for users, team, business.
