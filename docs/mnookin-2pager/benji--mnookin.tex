\section*{Hate Doing}

\begin{description}
 \item[Telling others to do things, pushing.]
I don't want to work in a place where goals are not aligned between teams which makes it hard to collaborate. I want to work in a place where peers are motivated and onboarded with the goals and strategy.
I do need to work here: a PM role entails mentoring and coaching others to achieve their goals too.
 %  I seek collaboration, not to be my teammates' boss.
 \item[Overworking.] Except one sprint at night or weekend once a quarter, or once a year.
 Not a given.
 \item[Useless meetings.] Goal: <2 per day,  <5/6 per week. %  No unlimited meeting invites please.
 \item[Reporting.]
%  Stakeholders need to
 I communicate progress, %with focus on
 and delivering value. %, %not presentation.
 Else can become micro-management.
  \item[Bureaucracy.] Good PMs negotiate well.
  % good at handling several stakeholders %can have good outcomes or bad ones % depends on many factors, including company direction:
  But stakeholders overstepping hurts the building process.
% % % % % % % % % % % %
%  I dislike delaying results and delivery:

 self, others, team, company.
 My view %of the company and team
 makes me %super
 high drive, and persistent.
\item[Curious.] I love learning, but my fuel is in placing questions forward and not staying stagnant with a simple eternal answer. Iteration and nuance are key.
\item[Supportive.] I push causes to happen, and I believe we can all give something out to the world. wagmi: we're all gonna make it.
\item[Ownership.] I believe to have both confidence and certainty to move forward, and I strive for other people to gain them as well.
\item[Strategist.] Always aiming for the big picture: am I going to be happy about this work in 20 to 50/200 years? I hope so. Let's plan steps and execute!

 I get excited about a conversation and want to contribute. Video calls do help with this:
 because you have to unmute, and really

%  pay attention to pauses in conversation before speaking.
 \item[Overly Imaginative:] going off rail to derivatives can be unproductive for working on immediate goals. Let's better plan one step at a time %so we can
