**Rodrigo:** [00:00:59.3] Here's a monocular, in case you want to see. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:01:17.1] I have a monocular, and two binoculars. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:01:26.4] Gracias!

**Interviewer:**  [00:01:41.9] Do guanacos like the forest, or [a pire?]?

**Rodrigo:** [00:01:45.0] They're only in the steppe. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:02:39.6] It's frozen.

**Interviewer:**  [00:02:53.2] Oh. The waterfall is frozen! [Looking through monocular.]



**Rodrigo:** [00:05:04.4] [Igniting engine ...] Ah. You were all afraid. I was afraid. ... What a moment!

 [00:05:30.9] It was a burnt fuse. I felt stupidly happy. Because it was a stupid thing. I reviewed the fuses, but I was nervous. I didn't check on them properly. And later on Ezequiel looked at them too, 

 [00:06:00.9] he thought it was all fine. I didn't have any spare ones anyhow. I saw him yesterday. He was sure it was about the alarm. Aside from believing I couldn't do anything else the other day. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:08:19.9] This is the last stop before the lake. We're very close. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:15:37.2] Do you know?

**Interviewer:**  [00:15:42.2] Oh! What is that!?

**Rodrigo:**[showing] [00:15:49.8] [abrot?] [abrojo]

**Interviewer:**  [00:16:02.9] Did it hurt?

**Rodrigo:** [00:16:04.5] No. It doesn't hurt.

**Interviewer:**  [00:16:05.7] It's so cool!



**Rodrigo:** [00:17:29.4] I was just showing to the girls. It's abrot [abrojo], it's a fruit [fruto] that gets entangled in animal's hair to disperse. Inside they're full of seeds. [Cool]. When you're walking they stick to your pants. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:17:52.6] That's their means of reproduction. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:17:54.4] Of course. Of dispersion. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:18:21.3] Any chance that we see the chocolate flower? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:18:22.6] It's still in blossom period. So yes. I saw a one blossoming the other day in the lake, some two weeks ago. I would think they still should be some. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:18:35.9] Does it have a short period of duration?

**Rodrigo:** [00:18:36.5] Yes. It depends on the place. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:19:54.1] They don't sting. [No worries.]



**Interviewer:**  [00:20:21.2] Do find a lot thrown around?

**Rodrigo:** [00:20:21.9] Garbage? Yeah, a lot. I can't understand how people can throw a bottle through the window. But it happens. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:24:39.4] This is the end of the road. Over that way the road only follows up to the Gendarmería Post. 

 [00:24:58.2] Over here there's a kiosk where they sell food. 

 [00:25:51.5] This is the river. And the idea now is to cross a hanging bridge, and hike through a trail that goes over the left margin. And we have options for trail ways. Over this side and this other one. Over this side there's a little more of vertical challenge. But you get the best view of the lake, and you can see Glaciar Huemul. 

 [00:26:20.7] So the idea is to get over up to, to make a short hike, get to a waterfall that's great. The road is just like this, very calm, over this way. And this way is a more level trail. We arrive to a beach, but we don't have a view to the Glaciar Huemul. And the view of the lake is a little more narrow. 

 [00:26:43.2] Both walks are, going at a calm pace, half an hour to get there. And the same back. If go quicker we can arrive sooner. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:28:33.7] What does it seem to you? It's very calm. 



**Rodrigo's Acquaintance:**  [00:34:57.5] All cool? How's it hanging?

**Rodrigo:** [00:35:00.2] Just hanging. Doing a little job [changueando]. 

**Rodrigo's Acquaintance:** [00:35:04.2] Under water?

**Rodrigo:** [00:35:05.8] Now we're walking. Luckily. Because it's quite cold. But OK. All cool.  

**Rodrigo's Other Acquaintance:** [00:35:09.2] Hey!

**Rodrigo:** [00:35:20.5] Happy New Year! How did your year begin? Nice



**Rodrigo:** [00:35:44.1] Are you eating now?

**Interviewer:**  [00:35:45.0] Yeah. I'll have a hamburger.

**Rodrigo:** [00:35:49.3] Before the walk?

**Interviewer:**  [00:35:49.7] Yeah. A little risk. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:36:32.6] I brought tea and coffee so we can have something hot later. I prefer to go without much. 



**Interviewer:** [00:39:48.7] ¿Dónde está el lago? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:39:51.5] Some 100 metres away. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:40:01.3] Did you see trouts? Fishes? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:40:06.7] Yes yes. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:43:40.7] This road goes to the North border. It crosses the whole lake. And you have a lot of places along the road where you can stop by. And with nice views. Over this side you can arrive to a beach that is very nice and is level. Over this side it's descaled. Whatever you prefer. Over this side is a better view. 

 [00:44:18.7] You can see the Spignani range, the glaciers. That's the one I recommend. It's more descaled. But a bit. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:52:55.9] Ready for a nap or should we go? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:52:58.8] Siesta! 



**Rodrigo:** [00:53:21.7] Would you like to use a cane? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:53:23.3] Thank you!

**Rodrigo:** [00:54:37.0] I use it at a 90 degree angle. 

 [00:55:29.5] It's best not to use the strip. Because sometimes you can fall down, and you entangle with the strip and you hurt your hand. [I'll let them know.]



**Rodrigo:** [00:56:40.9] If you go one by one, it's easier because the bridge doesn't move. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:57:27.8] Moss. Don't touch! Because any people that touch it, they draw, they make faces. 

 [00:58:13.0] The environment is very different to the one that you saw in the trail to Torre, or during the prior transition that we did. Here it's already a more humid place and it's represented with a lot of moss, there are ferns, which are plants from humid places. The trees also have a different shape. The forest is bigger. From over there up to here we saw shorter forest, and the limit between steppe and forest, which is ... Well we don't see that anymore. Here it's only forest. 



**Rodrigo:** [00:59:30.8] All this, they call it old man's beard [barba de viejo]. That's the common name [vulgar/popular]. And it's a very peculiar variety, because it's a symbiosis between a fungus and an algae. It's called lichen. And it's only represented in places where there's no contamination. It's a good bio indicator, of environmental quality.   



**Rodrigo:** [01:00:43.4] As of species, those representative of the forest, there are two dominant species of trees. The ñire, and the lenga. They are from the same family, which is Nothofagus, Nothofagaceae. And this is the ñire, that you can tell because of its leaf. And the lenga... This is ñire too. ... We'll look for a lenga. This could be one.

 [01:01:20.8] No. This one is ñire too. ... This one too. 

 [01:01:33.2] I'll show you the difference when I find both together. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:02:19.2] Did you meet any Calafate? The plant. Did you eat it? [Yes!] I think it's not yet ripe. ...No. Acid. Not ready.



**Rodrigo:** [01:03:19.3] Here's the example. This one is a lenga. The shape of the trees are very similar. But this one is a lenga, and this other is a ñire. And the difference is in the leaf. Because the border of the lenga is rounded, and the edge of the ñire is like a saw shape. The species are very similar. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:05:22.5] These are orchids, yellow "wand" (phalaenopsis) [vara amarilla]. One particularity of these orchids, here in Patagonia is that they're in the floor. Not on the trees. Which happens in more jungle spaces. They normally live on top of other species. 

 [01:06:34.9] A face! This is something that they do with fingers. That's why it says: Don't touch. 

 [01:08:56.7] And this is the lake. You can notice some whirlpools over there in the back. Sometimes they become into big swirls and they lift up. 

 [01:09:41.0] The landscape, in general over here in the valley of Lago del Desierto, is repeated all over the area, of glaciers. In old times, this used to be covered by glaciers, and when the glaciers moved backwards, they generated rocks to detach, and moraine marks.  

 [01:10:03.0] In this case, we can see big boulders spread around the area, which are due to the drag by the glaciers, and also due to the detachment because of the inclination. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:10:31.1] Has anyone ever lived here? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:10:35.6] Yes. The first settlers of the area were ... Well, I'm not sure if they were the first, but there have been families, that are still in town, of generations that have lived around here. And in Punta Norte as well. With cattle. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:10:59.6] How long ago was that? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:11:00.7] In the 1900s there were people. 

 [01:12:37.9] How are you doing? Fine? Hamburger good? 

 [01:16:21.9] That is the Glaciar Huemul. [showing] 

 [01:16:47.2] We can make a stop. 

 [01:18:48.8] What happened? ... Oh. Because of the rain? My idea was to reach to a waterfall that is not far away, but whatever you prefer. If rain begins here it starts just little by little. So inside the forest we'll be fine. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:20:25.7] How far away is the waterfall? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:20:28.0] 200 or 300 metres away. [going on]



**Rodrigo:** [01:23:58.8] No? OK. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:30:13.7] From Chaltén it looked like it was going to be a good day. In the morning ... 



**Rodrigo:** [01:31:55.1] Yes. I like to associate the concept of wild with nature. I understand that enjoying or living in the wild is enjoying the good things that an environment can provide us. And also to live upon the adversities that each environment has. And each living creature, each individual being in each space, could thrive over those adversities, and benefit from the graces of each place. 

 [01:32:38.3] So I associate the word savage (salvaje) with being able to subsist in a certain location. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:32:53.0] I do consider Patagonia to be savage. Considering that it's all a little bit more complex, because if we're talking about the same thing again there are a lot of adversities, related to the whether in Patagonia. It doesn't gift you anything at all. So if would compare with human beings, surviving in Patagonia without any services, like gas, light, it would be much more difficult than in any other place where there are a lot more benefits or matters more at hand to benefit from.

 [01:33:40.5] So I do see Patagonia as a savage place. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:34:31.1] At least over here in the area, on our life time over here, which is more or less new, I believe that the cultural construction is totally linked to the environment, and to nature. We can't generate or form a cultural identity of a place like this one, because we can't forget where we are, 

 [01:35:00.3] because each time that we go out we have to carry a backpack with clothes, coats, cover, because of the rain, as I am now. With hot water. So I think that Patagonia's cultural construction is totally linked to nature and to its own savagery.



**Rodrigo:** [01:35:43.1] I believe that it does belong to the savage places, but one of the requirements for a place to prosper with its nature, is that each person that comes to live to these places has to be able to appropriate with that identity. And it's the only way that I can find that society can pursue with urban and demographic growth, and of different human endeavours.  

 [01:36:19.2] Along with nature. Because when you get to know where you're at, and begin to appreciate the surroundings and love it all, is when ... It's the only way of taking care of it. So I think that yes, there is a connection. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:37:15.8] This kind of waves is not normal in the area. There are waves by wind normally. But these are waves like currents. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:37:28.5] There's either a strong rain or snow above ...

**Rodrigo:** [01:37:29.2] Maybe there's a wind over there that's dragging things up. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:40:38.3] In autumn the whole forest turns into these colours: yellow, and ... I am not sure if you've seen videos of the area, before the leaves fall. It all looks very very nice. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:42:04.4] Can I take a picture of the group over here? 

 [01:42:35.4] Facebook, instagram, blog? 

 [01:42:56.0] We have a new site, a blog. We're going to start generating content. So if we can add any content from your project... That would be nice. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:43:42.5] Asking about working and earning.

**Rodrigo:** [01:43:50.5] Enough to be happy. 

 [01:44:06.3] Because for people working in tourism here ... 

 [01:49:21.8] Is that very heavy? To walk!

 [01:49:55.1] And three days ... Sure!

 [01:51:26.1] Coffee or tea? Right inside the car or outside here.

 [01:53:27.1] What would you like? Tea, chamomile, mint, chocolates, ...

 [01:55:28.2] Mate (cocido)? 

 [01:56:29.2] They saw by flight. And they saw nothing, and said, this is just a lake. Like as if there was nothing in the area. That's what I had understood. 

 [01:57:28.3] I never knew the actual difference. I think that you say it's cooked because you use boiling water. Simply yerba mate inside a sock. Since tea is done with boiling water, they call it mate cocido. 

 [01:58:03.1] Because regular mate is drank with hot water, but not to the point of boiling. 

 [02:01:11.1] Uruguay. And I though it was a joke. But they go around in motorcycle with a thermos. [Laughing]

 [02:03:28.3] To a lot of people it's kind of disgusting to share the straw [of the yerba mate]. Which is quite disgusting. We're just used to it. 

**Interviewer:**  [02:03:36.1] They just saw that I shared with the people next to us. 

**Rodrigo:** [02:03:37.4] Yeah. And you didn't know them. So it may look a bit weird.
