Dear Lua,

I am aiming for the Project Manager role.

For the past 3 years, I've been working in the tech industry with global
teams remotely and async. I trained as a backend developer for a season:
the team teached me Agile practices, working as an independent and
autonomous nucleus producing meaningful outcomes periodically. As a
technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and marketing teams:
interviewing regularly with developers as subject-matter-experts, I
valued their knowledge and the relationships they opened up to me, so
this triggered me to aim and foster further these kind of conversations.

Later, I worked as a Project Manager close to the Development and QA
teams: an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory role, since the
team builds and sees hand offs to the end users thru quick iterations. I
have grown from technical positions to more hands-on roles, with ever
more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs, users, and
clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing on
teamwork, and making the best use of time.

I believe that my background as a sociologist gives me awareness of all
sides' needs, and fits me well for interviews, research and testing; I
also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User Experience
\[UX\], all of which I hope helps to deliver great products, and
enjoyment with final results for all parties.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials. Sincerely
yours,

Benjamin Juarez
