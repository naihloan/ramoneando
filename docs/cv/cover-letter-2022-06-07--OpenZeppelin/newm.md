Hi Tiziana and Shawn, I'm interested in the UX/UI Researcher role you've
opened a month ago.

tl,dr: I love music and web3, and have been playing bass for the last
year. my favorite music genres are grunge, indie, electronic; and I
would like to find more in-depth.

I understand now that the role is filled: Marcos Pezzoti told me so. All
the same, Shawn pointed out that it'd be OK to send you my cv. A little
about how I may fit for the role: the past 3 years:

1.  I trained as a backend developer for a season: the team taught me
    Agile practices, and to work as an independent and autonomous nucleus
    to produce meaningful outcomes periodically.

2.  As a technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and
    marketing teams: regularly interviewing developers as subject
    matter experts, I valued their knowledge and the relationships they
    opened up to me, so this triggered me to aim and foster further
    these kinds of conversations.

3.  I worked as a Project Manager close to the Development and QA teams:
    an attractive, challenging, and satisfactory role, since the team
    builds and sees hand-offs to the end-users thru quick iterations. I
    have grown from technical positions to more hands-on roles, with
    ever more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs, users,
    and clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing on
    teamwork, and making the best use of time.

Aside from my work experience, I believe that my background as a
sociologist (I did research and got a grant for a Master's degree) gives
me: an awareness of all sides' needs; fits me well for interviews,
research, and testing; I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and
attending to User Experience [UX] all of which I hope help to deliver
great products, and enjoyment with final results for all parties;

Combining being a detective, and a scientist, with creative solutions:
to me is a dream job description.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials. Sincerely
yours,

Benjamin Juarez
