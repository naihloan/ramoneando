Dear Victoria and Conner,

I am aiming for the Technical Project Manager - Security Services role.

For the past 3 years, I've been working in the tech industry with global
teams remotely and async. I trained as a backend developer for a season:
the team taught me Agile practices, working as an independent and
autonomous nucleus producing meaningful outcomes periodically. As a
technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and marketing teams:
interviewing regularly with developers as subject matter experts, I
valued their knowledge and the relationships they opened up to me, so
this triggered me to aim and foster further these kinds of
conversations.

Later, I worked as a Project Manager close to the Development and QA
teams: an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory role, since the
team builds and sees hand-offs to the end-users thru quick iterations. I
have grown from technical positions to more hands-on roles, with ever
more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs, users, and
clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing on
teamwork, and making the best use of time.

I believe that my background as a sociologist gives me an awareness of
all sides' needs, and fits me well for interviews, research, and
testing; I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User
Experience \[UX\], all of which I hope help to deliver great products,
and enjoyment with final results for all parties.

In my last job, as a Project Manager, I reached significant milestones:

-   1st trainee, out of 4, to prototype: new features' implementation
    for a client CRM

-   building a product for the internal talent team: an ATS \[Applicant
    Tracking System\] from scratch

-   relaunch the company User Experience thru: our webpage, CTAs,
    landing page and squeeze pages

-   design reboot of our internal email platform: a clean, functional,
    minimal User Interface \[UI\]

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials. Sincerely
yours,

Benjamin Juarez
