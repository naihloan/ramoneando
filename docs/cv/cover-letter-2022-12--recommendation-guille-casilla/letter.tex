Dear Ignacio Cantera,

Guille has worked as a Project Manager for a year, we started working together at the same time at a US company in direct contact with the business owner, the CEO. I am always impressed over how natural it comes to him, and how much he likes to be of use at our organization and for our clients. 

He has made the GTD (Getting Things Done) approach a core of his procedures and manages easily to prioritize, handle the backlog, and follow up with the developing and Quality Assurance teams. Guille's a hard worker, learns fast and with great drive. He has an inclination for the numbers' side of strategy, which is very insightful to handle the finance budget, time estimations with the internal team, as well as taking care of all involved parties. Overall, he has massive skills and values: I hope you can joint forces, and find the best possible match. 

I recommend Guille for any management role and congratulate in advance to whoever is considering to getting him on board. Once he's on your side, you'll see how quick and strong he moves forward, and moves the rest of the team to a higher ground.

Best regards,
