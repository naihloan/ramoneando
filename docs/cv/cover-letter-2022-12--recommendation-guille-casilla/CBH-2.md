  Clipboard Health

  --------------------

Dear Veena,

I am aiming for the Senior Product Manager role.

This is my second application at Clipboard Health, after applying for a Product Operations Position. Upon your suggestion for this role, and over a further review of the company, I am further impressed by the strong remote culture, growth, overall positive energy thriving into the near future, and the company's mission. I'd like to join that spirit.

A little about my background, and how I may fit for the role. For the past 3 years, I've been working in the tech industry with global
teams remotely and async. First, I trained as a backend developer for a
season: the team taught me Agile practices, working as an independent
and autonomous nucleus producing meaningful outcomes periodically.
Secondly, as a technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and
marketing teams: interviewing regularly with developers as subject
matter experts, I valued their knowledge and the relationships they
opened up to me, so this triggered me to aim and foster further these
kinds of conversations.

Later, in a another stage, I worked as a Project Manager close to the
Development and QA teams: an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory
role, since the team builds and sees hand-offs to the end-users thru
quick iterations. I have grown from technical positions to more hands-on
roles, with ever more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs,
users, and clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing
on teamwork, and making the best use of time.

I believe that my background as a sociologist gives me:

-   An awareness of all sides' needs

-   Fits me well for interviews, research, and testing

-   I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User
    Experience \[UX\] all of which I hope help to deliver great
    products, and enjoyment with final results for all parties

-   Combining being a detective, and a scientist, with creative solutions:

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials.\
