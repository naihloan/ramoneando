Dear Recruiters,

I am aiming for the Strategic Product Manager role.

A little about my 
% background, and 
how I may fit for the role.
Over 
the 
past 3 years:
% , I used several hats.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
% 1)
I trained as a backend developer for a season: 
the team taught me Agile practices, working as an independent
and autonomous nucleus producing meaningful outcomes periodically.
\item 
% 2) 
As a technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and
marketing teams: interviewing regularly with developers as subject
matter experts, I valued their knowledge and the relationships they
opened up to me, so this triggered me to aim and foster further these
kinds of conversations.
\item 
% 3) 
I worked as a Project Manager close to the
Development and QA teams: 
an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory role, 
since the team builds and sees hand-offs to the end-users thru quick iterations. 
I have grown from technical positions to more hands-on
roles, with ever more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs,
users, and clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing
on teamwork, and making the best use of time.
\end{enumerate}

Aside from my work experience, 
I believe that my background as a sociologist gives me:
% \vspace{-\topsep}
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
  an awareness of all sides' needs;
% \item
  fits me well for interviews, research, and testing;
% \item
  I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User
  Experience {[}UX{]} all of which I hope help to deliver great
  products, and enjoyment with final results for all parties;
% \item

Combining being a detective, and a scientist, with creative solutions:
  to me is a dream job description.
% \end{itemize}

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials.\\
Sincerely yours,

Benjamin Juarez
