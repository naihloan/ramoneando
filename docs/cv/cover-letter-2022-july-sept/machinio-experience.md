For the past 3 years, I've been working in the tech industry with global
teams remotely and async. I trained as a backend developer for a season:
the team taught me Agile practices, working as an independent and
autonomous nucleus producing meaningful outcomes periodically.

As a technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and marketing
teams: interviewing regularly with developers as subject matter experts,
I valued their knowledge and the relationships they opened up to me, so
this triggered me to aim and foster further these kinds of
conversations.

Later, I worked as a Project Manager close to the Development and QA
teams, and UX: an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory role, since
the team builds and sees hand-offs to the end-users thru quick
iterations. I have grown from technical positions to more hands-on
roles, with ever more contact with several stakeholders, such as CEOs,
users, and clients; aiming to deliver solid and timely results, focusing
on teamwork, building requirements, preparing budgets, prototyping and
making the best use of time. I also developed a hunger for a product
vision, and understanding users closely with testing and continual
rapport.
