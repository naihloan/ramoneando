## Long-answer questions
We plan to mark your answers to these questions blinded, i.e. with the evaluator not knowing your name when they mark them. For this reason, we ask that you not include identifying information in your answers as far as reasonably possible. 

We recommend that you prepare your responses in a separate document to avoid losing your progress due to technical problems.  

The character limits are a maximum only: a much shorter answer than the maximum is entirely acceptable.

Important note: We expect nearly all candidates to answer these questions. However, it is acceptable for you to skip them if you want to. Skipping these questions may significantly disadvantage your application, however if you're pressed for time and wouldn't apply otherwise, or if you're highly confident that your CV will give us enough information to progress you to the next stage, it could make sense to skip.

## Interest in the role
Please describe your interest in the role. For example: what aspects of the role most appeal to you; why you're interested in applying. (Max: 1500 characters, including spaces.)

I'm interested firstly in the organization: An altruistic mission that looks far away into the future is novel and aiming to make the biggest impact with proper tools is why we come to this world. That is truly inspiring and empowering.

On a personal level, I feel challenged and excited by the combination of scholarship and work in technology, in my life, I have enjoyed both realms separately and it would be a dream job to make them merge, working with both at the same time. 

A small-sized team, and independence to work, are the most powerful combination. This, along with the network of people, skills, and sharing is the best base for building up work that is supported by an active community, and allows me to engage and grow. I'd love to go to EA Global conferences.

As per the role, as an Operations Manager, I believe I can be the proper enabler to support the rest of the team, connecting new paths outside to the world, as well as inside of the Effective Altruism social world.

## Relevant experience or skills
Please describe some previous experience or skills you have that may make you a good fit for this role. We'd prefer you to relate your answer to some or all of the desired skills and qualities from the "About You" section of our job description, though if you have previous experience in a similar role, the relationship to our requirements may be self-evident. (Max: 2500 characters, including spaces.)

* Proactivity. I have been working remotely for over 2 years and I have always been on top of my projects in a timely way, with deliverables properly finished and working with a team. 
* Problem-solving ability. As a project manager, I've been able to detect early problems and discuss and execute potential solutions. Also, time constraint plays an important role, so I got accustomed to evaluating the cost-effectiveness of all decisions.
* Organised: The key to an organized system is to take into account all elements you need to put in order and give them a place in a list of priorities. Tech tools here come in handy, but it is the person in charge who is responsible for keeping track of the list, and keeping it moving so that people who depend on you can be calm and know that they will receive what they need. 
* Good communicator: This is mostly the most enjoyable part of the job, you get to listen to your teammates and colleagues and help where they need you most. This is the one that I've enjoyed the most, you only have to be careful not to misinterpret what people are asking you for, and capture all subtleties to fully commit to others' needs.
* Attention to detail: I am very attentive to detail, only that my strong suit is closer to the UX design of a tech product or data display, rather than in accounting. Although I have worked with an open-book system, and have learned to spot the details there too.
* Good IT Skills: I've worked for the past 2 years in tech development, and I am completing my studies as a Systems Analyst. 
* Willingness to take on administrative tasks as well as strategic tasks: Yes.

## Involvement with high-impact communities or projects 
Please describe any previous involvement you have had with the effective altruism community, CLR's priorities, or other projects that aim to have a positive social impact. You can leave this blank if you haven't previously had such involvement, or if it's already obvious from your earlier questions. (Max: 1000 characters, inc. spaces.)

I've had the chance to work with several organizations with positive social impact, always at a local level, and would like to join forces to make a bigger impact. When I was a teenager I participated in an organization called "Techo" (Roof) that gave housing to impoverished communities; I worked for several years in different roles, as an interviewer, a builder, and as a cook. Later on, I was a founding member of an organization that aims to support NU's Sustainable Development Goals: Organization for Sustainable Development. Here I have worked mostly as a copy editor and have supported the management and preparation of monthly events, as well as yearly gatherings. Once in a while, over the years in the organization, I give presentations on how to do vermicomposting and explain to the public the basics of handling earthworms.
