The Parable of Hank
===================

This morning I heard a knock at my door. When I answered the door, I
found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first.

**John:** "Hi! I'm John, and this is Mary."

**Mary:** "Hi! We're here to invite you to come [kiss Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer) with us."

**Me:** "Pardon me? What are you talking about? Who's
[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God), and why would I want to [kiss
his ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer)?"

**John:** "If you [kiss Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer), he'll give you [a million
dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven); and if you don't, he'll
[kick the shit out of you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation)."

**Me:** "What?! Is this some sort of bizarre
[mob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia)
[shake-down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion)?"

**John:** "[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) is [a billionaire
philanthropist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence). Hank
[built this town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth). Hank owns
this town. He can [do whatever he
wants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence), and what he wants is
to give you [a million dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven),
but he can't until you [kiss his
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer)."

**Me:** "That doesn't make any sense. Why ..."

**Mary:** "Who are you to question
[Hank's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) gift? Don't you want [a
million dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)? Isn't it worth a
little [kiss on the ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer)?"

**Me:** "Well maybe, if it's legit, but ..."

**John:** "Then come [kiss Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer) with us."

**Me:** "Do you [kiss Hank's ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer)
often?"

**Mary:** "Oh yes, all the time!"

**Me:** "And has he given you [a million
dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)?"

**John:** "Well no, you don't actually get [the
money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) until you [leave
town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death)."

**Me:** "So why don't you just [leave town
now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide)?"

**Mary:** "You can't [leave town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death)
until [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) tells you to, or you
don't get [the money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) *and* he
[kicks the shit out of you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation)."

**Me:** "Do you know anyone who [kissed Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer), [left
town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death), and got [the million
dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)?"

**John:** "My mother [kissed Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer) for years. She [left
town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death) last year, and I'm sure she
got [the money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)."

**Me:** "Haven't you [talked to
her](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seance) since then?"

**John:** "Of course not, [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)
doesn't allow it."

**Me:** "So what makes you think he'll actually give you [the
money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) if you've never [talked to
anyone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seance) who got [the
money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)?"

**Mary:** "Well, he gives you a little bit before you [leave
town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death). Maybe you'll get a raise,
maybe you'll win a small lotto, maybe you'll just find a twenty dollar
bill on the street."

**Me:** "What's that got to do with
[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)?"

**John:** "[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) has [certain
*connections*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence)*.*"

**Me:** "I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre [con
game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_game)."

**John:** "But it's [a million
dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) - [can you really take the
chance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager)? And remember, if
you don't [kiss Hank's ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer), he'll
[kick the shit out of you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation)."

**Me:** "Maybe if I could see [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God),
talk to him, get the details straight from him ..."

**Mary:** "No one sees [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God), no one
talks to [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)."

**Me:** "Then how do you [kiss his
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer)?"

**John:** "Sometimes we just [blow him a kiss, and think of his
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer). Other times we kiss [Karl's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy), and he passes it on."

**Me:** "Who's [Karl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy)?"

**Mary:** "A friend of ours. He's the one who
[taught](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination) us all about
[kissing Hank's ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer). All we had to
do was [take him out to dinner a few
times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe)."

**Me:** "And you just took his word for it when he said [there was a
Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God), that
[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) wanted you to [kiss his
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer), and that
[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) would reward you?"

**John:** "Oh no! [Karl's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy) got [a
letter Hank sent him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) years ago
explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself."

John handed me [a photocopy of a handwritten memo on *From the desk of
Karl* letterhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible). There were eleven
items listed:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ``
>
> From the desk of KARL:

**Me:** "This would appear to be written on
[Karl's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy) letterhead."

**Mary:** "[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) didn't have any
paper."

**Me:** "I have a hunch that if we checked we'd find this is
[Karl's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy)
[handwriting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting)."

**John:** "Of course, [Hank dictated
it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_inspiration)."

**Me:** "I thought you said no one gets to see
[Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)?"

**Mary:** "Not now, but years ago he would [talk to some
people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_revelation)."

**Me:** "I thought you said he was [a
philanthropist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence). What sort
of philanthropist [kicks the shit out of
people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution) just because
they're different?"

**Mary:** "It's what [Hank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) wants, and
[Hank's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) always right."

**Me:** "How do you figure that?"

**Mary:** "Item 7 says, '[Everything Hank says is
right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy).' That's good
enough for me!"

**Me:** "Maybe your friend [Karl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy)
just made the whole thing up."

**John:** "No way! Item 5 says, '[Hank dictated this list
himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_inspiration).' Besides,
item 2 says, 'Use
[alcohol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage) in
moderation,' item 4 says, '[Eat
right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition),' and item 8 says, '[Wash
your hands after going to the
bathroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene).' [Everyone knows those
things are right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge), so the
rest must be true too."

**Me:** "But 9 says '[Don't
drink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism),' which [doesn't quite
go
with](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_and_the_Bible)
item 2, and 6 says '[The moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) is
made of [green cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_cheese),'
which is just plain wrong."

**John:** "There's [no
contradiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_and_the_Bible)
between 9 and 2. 9 just clarifies 2. As far as 6 goes, [you've never
been](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience) to [the
moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), so [you can't say for
sure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_knowledge)."

**Me:** "Scientists have pretty firmly established that [the
moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) is made of rock ..."

**Mary:** "But they don't know if the rock came from [the
Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), or from [outer
space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space), so it could just as
easily be [green cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_cheese)."

**Me:** "I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that [the
Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) came from [the
Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) has been discounted. Besides,
[not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it
cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy)."

**John:** "*Aha!* You just admitted that
[scientists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist) make
[mistakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error), but we know [Hank is
always right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy)!"

**Me:** "We do?"

**Mary:** "Of course we do, item 5 says so."

**Me:** "You're saying [Hank's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) always
right because [the list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) says so,
[the list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) is right because [Hank
dictated it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_inspiration), and we
know that [Hank dictated
it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_inspiration) because [the
list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) says so. That's [circular
logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_logic). That's no different
than saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.'"

**John:** "Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see [someone come
around](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion) to [Hank's
way of thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith)!"

**Me:** "But ... oh, never mind. What's the deal with
[wieners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse)?"

Mary blushes.

**John:** "[Wieners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_position),
in [buns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage), no
[condiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_(sexual)). It's
[Hank's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) way. Anything else is wrong."

**Me:** "What if I don't have a
[bun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage)?"

**John:** "No [bun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage), no
[wiener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse). A
[wiener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse) without a
[bun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage) is wrong."

**Me:** "No [relish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_(sexual))? No
[mustard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_(sexual))?"

Mary looks positively stricken.

**John:** *\[shouting\]* "There's no need for [such
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity)!
[Condiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_(sexual)) of any kind are
wrong!"

**Me:** "So, [a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in
it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_(sexual)) would be [out of the
question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perversion)?"

**Mary:** *\[sticking her fingers in her ears\]* "I am not listening to
this! La la la la la la la la!"

**John:** "That's [disgusting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perversion)!
Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that ..."

**Me:** "[It's good! I eat it all the
time.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum)"

Mary faints. John catches her.

**John:** "Well, if I'd known you were [one of
those](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervert), I wouldn't have wasted my
time! When Hank [kicks the shit out of
you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation), I'll be there, counting my
money and laughing! I'll [kiss Hank's
ass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer) for you, you [bunless
cut-wienered kraut-eater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervert)!"

With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and sped off.

Ketchup, anyone? :)
