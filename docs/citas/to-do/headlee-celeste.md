# 10 ways to have a better conversation | [Celeste Headlee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1vskiVDwl4)

1. don't multitask. be present. end conversation if needed, don't be half in and half out
2. don't pontificate. if needed, write a blog. set your opinion aside if you're willing to learn
3. use open ended questions. who what why where when how. complicated questions get simple answers. 
4. go with the flow. let go of the ideas that come to your mind. let stories come and go.
5. if you don't know, say so. err on the side of caution. talk shoudn't be cheap
6. don't equate your experience with theirs. both experiences are never the same. all experiences are individual. it's not about you. don't prove that you're amazing or have suffered. (not your time)
7. try not to repeat yourself. it's condescending, and boring. 
8. stay out of the weeds. people don't care about the details on names, years, etc. they care about you, what you're like, what you have in common. forget the details, leave them out.
9. # LISTEN. number 1 skill that you can develop. wanting to talk can seem easier, like in control. why don't we listen? we get distracted. it takes energy to listen, but if you don't, then you're not in the conversation. 
10. be brief. be interested in other people. be prepared to be amazed.
