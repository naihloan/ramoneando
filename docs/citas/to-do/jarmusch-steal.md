Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative

“Steal from anywhere that resonates
with inspiration or fuels your
imagination. Devour old films, new
films, music, books, paintings,
photographs, poems, dreams, random
conversations, architecture, bridges,
street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of
water, light and shadows. Select only
things to steal from that speak directly
to your soul. If you do this, your work
(and theft) will be authentic.”
—Jim Jarmusch
