  <blockquote> 
	<em>
	
<p>This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.</p>
<p>Now listen.</p>
<p>I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lift, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length.</p>
<p>And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the crymbals -sounds that say listen to this, it is important.</p>
