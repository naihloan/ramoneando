<p><strong>It's just a thing where anything that's good or original, it's probably bad news. [Laughs]. It's going to doom you to ten or fifteen years of things that are neither good nor original.</strong></p>
<p><em>I saw you on a TV programme called XXXTripping, where you were talking about magic. Now, it was all very fast cuts but you seemed to be saying that on one hand magic was ideas and secondly, spirits and entities was a second interpretation. I mean, [are] these all the one thing?</em></p>
<p>I’d say that, <strong>entities are a kind of compound idea</strong>, at least as far as I see them. And I do see them occasionally but they seem to me to be some sort of compound idea form.

<p><em>There might be entities that are indigenous to that space. Flora and fauna of the mental realm</em>, which I think is more than enough to explain all the demons, angels and chimera and UFO grey aliens and elves, leprechauns, pixies of all of our human culture.</p>
