<p>2016-04-21 My advice and opinions may sound strange on their own.</p>
<p>Do you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint">musical counterpoint</a> is?</p>
<p>Underneath the main melody, you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=counter-melody">counter-melody</a> that goes against it, and together they make harmony.</p>
<p>This is different than just harmonizing, where someone sings along with the melody at an interval. This is a separate melody that could stand on its own, but is really there to complement the main melody.</p>
<p>Well, if my advice and opinions sound strange, it’s because I’m just the counter-melody.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only voice you hear. There’s another message I know you are hearing, because it’s a common message we all hear these days. So let’s call that the melody.</p>
<p>I may love that melody too, but I don’t want to just duplicate it. So I try to think of a good counter-melody.</p>
<p>I do it to compensate (or <a href="/compensate">over-compensate</a>) for something I think is missing in the common message.</p>
<p><strong>My public writing is a counterpoint meant to complement the popular point.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a glorification of leadership and those who start companies. So I suggested that <a href="/ff">it’s more effective to be an early follower</a>.</li>
<li>The popular “law of attraction” says you should tell everyone your goals. So I shared an interesting study showing that <a href="/zipit">telling your plans makes them less likely to happen</a>.</li>
<li>To people who are too focused on money, I suggest that <a href="/a">generosity is a more effective path to success</a>.</li>
<li>To people who are too focused on passion and purpose, I suggest that money can lead you towards your purpose, because it shows you where you’re <a href="/starv">valuable to others</a>.</li>
<li>And I love pointing out that <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different">the opposite of anything may also be true</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you ask me if I think the stuff I say is the only way to go, <strong>of course not!</strong> I’m just the counter-melody.</p>
<p>My best advice is to listen to the <strong>combination</strong>. Eventually you’ll find yourself singing along with the melody you like best. Or making up your own.</p>
