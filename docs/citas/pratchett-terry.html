<h2>Terry Pratchett</h2>

<blockquote><em>
<p>Imagination, not intelligence, made us human.</p>
<p>Everything makes sense a bit at a time. But when you try to think of it all at once, it comes out wrong.</p>
<p>The pen is mightier than the sword if the sword is very short, and the pen is very sharp. </p>
<p>The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.</p>
<p>I don't think I've found God, but I may have seen where gods come from.</p>
<p>Belief was never mentioned at home, but right actions were taught by daily example. Possibly because of this, I have never disliked religion. I think it has some purpose in our evolution. I don't have much truck with the &quot;religion is the cause of most of our wars&quot; school of thought because that is manifestly done by mad, manipulative and power-hungry men who cloak their ambition in God. I number believers of all sorts among my friends. Some of them are praying for me. I'm happy they wish to do this, I really am, but I think science may be a better bet.</p>
<p>Who would not rather be a rising ape than a falling angel?</p>
</ul>
</blockquote></em>
