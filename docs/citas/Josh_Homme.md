-   The rules were always there. There was always one rule; don't break the golden rule, which is if someone says that they love your music, so they love you and you're amazing; you're not amazing. You're not amazing. It's not you, they don't know you, you know? It's not that way. So don't believe that. I don't believe that about myself, and I don't believe when someone likes me too much or hates me too much. I don't believe they know what they're talking about.

-   I think now is the best thing that you’ll ever get, and that’s all you’ll ever get.

-   Whenever someone says, 'We're all one,' I've always been like 'No
    we're not, and that's what's great, so stop saying that or
    everyone's gonna start believing you.' But yeah, as we all look at
    the same projection on the wall, we do become one, and I started to
    realize the horror of that. And I make no attempt to try to alter it
    from being that; my thing is more about trying to apply some
    principles of magic—how to walk between the raindrops—and take
    advantage of a situation like that, because it’s the only choice you
    have.

-   I'm also beyond pissed, as in not pissed, because I kinda figure
    they just don’t know better by now. It’s like when a dog shits in
    the house, you can hit 'em with a paper but they really don’t know
    what the fuck happened. How can retarded kids know to not throw a
    Frisbee at the forehead of another retarded kid?

-   It's like catching a fish, you know what I mean? It's the fish
    that's beautiful, not the fisherman. And I think whoever hasn't
    understood that attitude in Queens is not here any more. And if I
    ever think the fisherman's better than the fish, I hope someone
    fuckin' fires me too.

-   In Kyuss and Queens, we allow people to tape our shows, whether it's
    audio, video or both. You're doing that tonight, but you're no
    different than someone who buys the ticket. Because the exchanging
    of music is what should happen. It's one of the only things I like
    about The Grateful Dead, it's "do you want a tape from '67 on June
    2nd? You can get one". I probably wouldn't like the music on the
    tape, but it's still possible. My problem is that people sell our
    live shows for too much money. They should be the cost of the video
    and shipping. And in turn, MP3 take a record that I've spent money
    and time and put so much love into, take it, and just give it away.
    But they make the money. MP3 and Napster, they make tons of money,
    but they say "Oh, it's about free exchange!", but that just sounds
    like just another jack-off thief in the dark, that doesn't have guts
    enough to admit what they're doing. I had someone say something
    interesting to me in Canada, "Well, would you rather have the label
    fuck you over, or the fans fuck you over?". And I just said,
    "Neither!". And when it gets posed to me in such a way I sit there
    and think, "You know, what am I doing? Maybe I should skip through
    the countryside, playing flute (?)". Because MP3 certainly is like
    *\[stabbing sound and motion\]*. If you're an unsigned band, then it
    really helps, but then, you know? I don't wanna censor anyone, and
    I'm no one's daddy, I'm not going to monitor the internet, but I
    think there's a moral side to it too; I don't steal from you, you
    don't steal from me. Seems fair, you know?

    the music is fake, because fame isn't real.

-   (*In response to the question; "What are you going to tell a ten
    year old who wants to play guitar?"*) For me that's easy; when you
    expect anything from music, you expect too much. So you play for
    yourself, you play to enjoy it and you make the most of it for you,
    period. You don't - I never thought I would be doing this now. I
    feel so lucky to be doing this now - I can't believe this is what I
    do all the time. I know I'm not the greatest guitar player in the
    world, but I just love it. And I hope that's the only reason I'm
    here, you know? Because I think - I honestly think that that's
    enough.

-   *\[In response to the question "This record will probably be bigger
    than the last one, which was bigger than the one before, and so on.
    How big do you want to be?"\]* Man, I don't really give a shit. I
    mean... you know, let me just break it down; I love to play, I'm
    from a small town in the desert, I never thought I would be here and
    I just wanna play, man. I don't care if it's big or small, you know?
    Like, Nick is gone and that affects me the most, because I didn't
    want it to be that way. And some people are going to be like "Well,
    I don't like it now!" and to them I say *fucking goodbye*. This is
    goodbye. Let me be the first to say it, goodbye. Because all I'm
    doing is just wanting to just play. I just love to play music, and I
    like people, you know. And there's all kinds of things that get...
    shoved into that along the way, but that's not alright with me, you
    know? So, I want to say most of all, like, I'm just going to just
    show up and play. I'll let everyone else deal with that because I've
    already dealt with the hard part, you go ahead and deal with the
    easy part, whether you want to listen or not. And either way; I
    understand. Because, when it comes to the Queens, whatever everyone
    else is dealing with, I've dealt with it already, man. So I'll
    either be drinking with people after the show or not and it's going
    to be five, five thousand, five million, or five - I don't give a
    shit. Because I'm really proud of this record and I put a lot into
    it, I put what I am into it and after that I can't control it. It's
    not up to me, it's up to you, you know? And I'm okay with that
    because when I left the studio I knew I loved this stuff and I got
    to save my friendship, and both of that is a victory, you know? And
    the rest is up to you, and I'm okay with that too. So let's get it
    on.

-   *\[On "grunge"\]* Music's music, and the weird thing is Brant \[Bjork\] has said this before; Soundgarden and those bands and Nirvana, those are great bands, but they did not create rock and roll. This whole "grunge" bullshit that everyone's talking about. "Oh my gosh, it's amazing!", they did not create rock and roll! It is rock and roll music. It's good rock and roll, that's all it is. They did not start something, they don't corner the market on anything. *\[...\]* I think it's a shame, because it's a great media tool and it worked. Like, whoever thought of the word "grunge" should be rich by now because it's a great media trip, you know? But it's just all good rock and roll; Soundgarden, Nirvana, all these bands are just good rock and roll bands. People spend too much time categorizing what everything is. Just throw it on your turntable, throw it on you CD player or whatever you have and listen to it. Don't worry about what it is - no one cares, it doesn't matter anymore, you know? That's what should have happened, it shouldn't matter anymore what you are. There's so many, like, "fusion" everything and whatever that it shouldn't matter anymore, you know?
