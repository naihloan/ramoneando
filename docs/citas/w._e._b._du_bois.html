<h2 id="w.-e.-b.-du-bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</h2>
<p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (23 February 1868 – 27 August 1963) was an American civil rights activist, sociologist, educator, historian, author, editor, and scholar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The theory of democratic government is not that the will of the people is always right, but rather that normal human beings of average intelligence will, if given a chance, learn the right and best course by bitter experience.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Herein lies the tragedy of the age: not that men are poor, — all men know something of poverty; not that men are wicked, — who is good? not that men are ignorant, — what is Truth? Nay, but that men know so little of men.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The return from your work must be the satisfaction which that work brings you and the world's need of that work. With this, life is heaven, or as near heaven as you can get.</em></p>
