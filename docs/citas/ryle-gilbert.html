<!-- <li><p>There is a doctrine about the nature and place of the <a href="/wiki/Mind">mind</a> which is prevalent among <a href="/wiki/Theorist">theorists</a>, to which most <a href="/wiki/Philosopher">philosophers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psychologist">psychologists</a> and religious teachers subscribe with minor reservations. Although they admit certain theoretical difficulties in it, they tend to assume that these can be overcome without serious modifications being made to the architecture of the theory.... The official doctrine, which hails chiefly from <a href="/wiki/Rene_Descartes">Descartes</a>, is something like this. With the doubtful exceptions of idiots and infants in arms every human being has both a body and a mind. Some would prefer to say that every human being is both a body and a mind. His body and his mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body his mind may continue to exist and function.</p> -->

<!-- <li><p>The mind is its own place and in his inner life each of us lives the life of a ghostly Robinson Crusoe. People can see, hear and jolt one another’s bodies, but they are irremediably blind and deaf to the workings of one another’s minds and inoperative upon them.</p> -->

<!-- <li><p>Such in outline is the official theory. I shall often speak of it, with deliberate abusiveness, as &quot;<strong>the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine</strong>.&quot; I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake. It represents the facts of mental life as if they belonged to one logical type or category (or range of types or categories), when they actually belong to another. The dogma is therefore a philosopher’s myth.</p> -->

<!-- <li><p>Contemporary philosophers have exercised themselves with the problem of our knowledge of other minds. Enmeshed in the dogma of the ghost in the machine, they have found it impossible to discover any logically satisfactory evidence warranting one person in believing that there exist minds other than his own. I can witness what your body does, but I cannot witness what your mind does, and my pretensions to infer from what your body does to what your mind does all collapse, since the premises for such inferences are either inadequate or unknowable.</p> -->

<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li><p>The term <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a> came into currency in the English-speaking world in the 1950's, largely as a description of the debates initiated by Gilbert Ryle's pioneering book <em>The Concept of Mind</em>, published in 1949. Ryle's book was a polemic against the <a href="/wiki/Cartesian">Cartesian</a> idea that mental states are states of an immaterial substance. This polemic, and the ensuing discussion, turned on the question of the reducibility of mental events to behavioral dispositions. Ryle's central argument was that we had misconceived the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Logic">logic</a>&quot; of such words as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Belief">belief</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="/wiki/Sensation">sensation</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="/wiki/Conscious">conscious</a>,&quot; etc. He thought that the traditional, Cartesian theory of mind, had &quot;<em>misconstrued the type-distinction between disposition and exercise into its mythical bifurcation of unwitnessable mental causes and their witnessable physical effects</em>&quot; (pg 32). Ryle's attempt to do philosophy of mind as conceptual analysis was founded on the pre-<a href="/wiki/Quinean">Quinean</a> idea that philosophical puzzles arose out of misunderstandings of the logic of our language.</p> -->
