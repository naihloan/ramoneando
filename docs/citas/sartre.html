<p><em>I think they do it to pass the time, nothing more. But time is too large, it can't be filled up. Everything you plunge into it is stretched and disintegrates.</em> &ndash; [Diary entry of Friday (2 February), concerning a card game]</p>
<p><em>I exist. It is soft, so soft, so slow. And light: it seems as though it suspends in the air. It moves.</em></p>
<!-- <p><em>Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do.</em></p> -->
<!-- Monsieur … I do not believe in God; his existence has been disproved by Science. But in the concentration camp, I learned to believe in men. -->
<!-- As if there could be true stories: things happen in one way, and we retell them in the opposite way. -->	
<!-- <p><em>I construct my memories with my present. I am lost, abandoned in the present. I try in vain to rejoin the past: I cannot escape.</em></p> -->
<!-- The real nature of the present revealed itself: it was what exists, all that was not present did not exist. -->
<!-- The past is the luxury of proprietors. -->

<!-- For the moment, the jazz is playing; there is no melody, just notes, a myriad of tiny tremors. The notes know no rest, an inflexible order gives birth to them then destroys them, without ever leaving them the chance to recuperate and exist for themselves.... I would like to hold them back, but I know that, if I succeeded in stopping one, there would only remain in my hand a corrupt and languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even want that death: I know of few more bitter or intense impressions. -->

<p><em>faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: <strong>the world of explanations and reasons is not <mark>the world of existence</mark></strong>. </em> &ndash;[Reflections on a chestnut tree root.]
</p><em>You know, it's quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don't do it.</em></p>
<p><em>Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.</em></p>-->
