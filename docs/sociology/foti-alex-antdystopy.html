<p>thanks to the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring – a pathbreaking book on DDT’s nefari-
ous effects on the food chain – and the large demonstrations linked to the introduction of Earth Day (1970),
ecologism penetrated deeply into civil society, leading to the creation of international NGOs such as Greenpeace. [...]
Contemporary ecologism is very much indebted to
the publication of the spouses Meadows’ Limits to
Growth (1972, 1993, 2004). This was the first book to
call attention to the fact that the human development 
thrust had overcome the Earth’s reconstructive capacities. Likewise, James Lovelock’s Gaia
