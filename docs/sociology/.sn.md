### Spoiler alert / context for question

>!  There's a couple of episodes in the Supernatural series [Season 11, eps. 20-21...etc?] in which **God appears**, and does so as personified by an old-known character: The Lord appears as _Chuck_. Personal opinion: the conversations on these chapters try to tackle both the emotion of being in front of the Creator of all; and also the escepticism, reasoning and complaint of why he's not around. The answer: overparenting is not always the solution, in His words:

*Being overinvolved
is no longer parenting.*

Up to here is just to explain the motives and angles in which each character functions.

## To the Question
After talking about several matters He says that he wants to take a shower, and asks for the bathroom, where is it?
> - Where's the guest room? I could use a shower.

> - Uh, it's, um... just down the hallway --the fourth door on the left.

Hence the points for question, there must be some good explanation on why He wouldn't know that. Something along the lines of _Chuck, as he prefers to be called, has his humanity too..._ But this isn't enough it would seem. 

# How can God not know something? 
Isn't He supposed to be omniscient? (aside from his Sister, which is a whole other topic)

Edit. Later on He says he likes bacon. That's fine. But then porn... mild wtf? I mean, sex is nice. But doesn't xxx imply certain objectification (hence non holy/divine)?
