2020: second-year student as Systems Analyst.

I am adaptable, curious, and tenacious. 
I was born in Chicago, USA, and raised from age 7 in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. 
I always kept studying English, raising my level to a C1 [CEFR] standard.
Also, I use English daily by reading and writing. 
I have also learned to read, listen, and fluently speak Portuguese, living in Brazil for nearly two years.
