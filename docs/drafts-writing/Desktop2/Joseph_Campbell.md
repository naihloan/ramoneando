Wherever the [hero](/wiki/Hero "Hero"){.mw-redirect} may wander,
whatever he may do, he is ever in the presence of his own
[essence](/wiki/Essence "Essence") — for he has the
[perfected](/wiki/Perfected "Perfected"){.mw-redirect}
[eye](/wiki/Eye "Eye"){.mw-redirect} to
[see](/wiki/See "See"){.mw-redirect}. There is no separateness.




-   In the absence of an effective general
    [mythology](/wiki/Mythology "Mythology"), each of us has his
    private, unrecognized, rudimentary, yet secretly potent pantheon of
    [dreams](/wiki/Dreams "Dreams").
    -   Chapter 1

-   **It has always been the prime function of mythology and rite to
    supply the [symbols](/wiki/Symbols "Symbols") that carry the
    [human](/wiki/Human "Human"){.mw-redirect} spirit forward, in
    counteraction to those that tend to tie it back. In
    [fact](/wiki/Fact "Fact"), it may very well be that the very high
    incidence of neuroticism among ourselves follows the decline among
    us of such effective spiritual aid.** We remain fixated to the
    unexorcised images of our
    [infancy](/wiki/Infancy "Infancy"){.mw-redirect}, and hence
    disinclined to the
    [necessary](/wiki/Necessary "Necessary"){.mw-redirect} passages of
    our adulthood.
    -   Chapter 1

<!-- -->

-   If we could dredge up something forgotten not only by ourselves but
    by our whole generation or our entire
    [civilization](/wiki/Civilization "Civilization"), we should become
    indeed the
    [boonbringer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boon "wiktionary:boon"){.extiw},
    the [culture
    hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_hero "w:Culture hero"){.extiw}
    of the day—a personage of not only local but
    [world](/wiki/World "World")
    [historical](/wiki/Historical "Historical"){.mw-redirect}
    [moment](/wiki/Moment "Moment"). In a word: **the first work of the
    hero is to retreat from the world scene of secondary effects to
    those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties really
    reside, and there to clarify the difficulties, eradicate them in his
    own case** (i.e., give battle to the nursery demons of his
    local culture) **and break through to** the undistorted, direct
    experience and assimilation of what [C. G.
    Jung](/wiki/Carl_Jung "Carl Jung") called **"the [archetypal
    images](/wiki/Carl_Jung#The_Archetypes_and_the_Collective_Unconscious_.281934.29 "Carl Jung")."**
    This is the process known to [Hindu](/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") and

    "discrimination."

-   **[Dream](/wiki/Dream "Dream"){.mw-redirect} is personalized myth,

    [quirked](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quirked "wiktionary:quirked"){.extiw}
    by the peculiar troubles of the dreamer, whereas in myth the problem
    and solutions shown are directly valid for all mankind.**
    -   Chapter 1

<!-- -->

-   The multitude of men and women choose the less adventurous way of
    the comparatively unconscious civic and tribal routines. But these
    seekers, too, are saved—by the virtue of the inherited symbolic aids
    of society, the rites of passage, the grace-yielding sacraments,
    given to mankind of old by the redeemers and handed down through
    the millenniums. **It is only those who know neither an inner call
    nor an outer doctrine whose plight is truly desperate; that is to
    say, most of us today, in this
    [labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth "w:Labyrinth"){.extiw}
    without and within the heart. Alas, where is the guide**, that fond
    virgin,
    [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne "w:Ariadne"){.extiw},
    to supply the simple clue that will give us the courage to face the
    [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur "w:Minotaur"){.extiw},
    and the means to find our way to freedom when the monster has been
    met and slain?
    -   Chapter 1

-   **Most curiously, the very
    [scientist](/wiki/Scientist "Scientist"){.mw-redirect} who, in the
    service of the [sinful](/wiki/Sin "Sin")
    [king](/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy"), was the
    [brain](/wiki/Brain "Brain") behind the horror of the
    [labyrinth](/wiki/Labyrinth "Labyrinth"), quite as readily can serve
    the purposes of [freedom](/wiki/Freedom "Freedom"). But the
    [hero](/wiki/Hero "Hero"){.mw-redirect}-[heart](/wiki/Heart "Heart")
    must be at [hand](/wiki/Hand "Hand"){.mw-redirect}. ...He is the
    hero of the way of thought—singlehearted, courageous, and full of
    faith that the truth, as he finds it, shall make us free.**
    -   Chapter 1

<!-- -->

-   Centuries of [husbandry](/wiki/Husbandry "Husbandry"), decades of
    diligent culling, the work of numerous hearts and hands, have gone
    into the hackling, sorting, and spinning of this tightly
    twisted yarn. **Furthermore, we have not even to
    [risk](/wiki/Risk "Risk") the
    [adventure](/wiki/Adventure "Adventure") alone; for the heroes of
    [all](/wiki/All "All"){.mw-redirect} [time](/wiki/Time "Time") have
    gone before us; the labyrinth is thoroughly known; we have only to
    follow the thread of the hero-path. And where we had thought to find
    an abomination, we shall find a [god](/wiki/God "God"); where we had
    thought to slay another, we shall slay
    [ourselves](/wiki/Egotism "Egotism"); where we had thought to travel
    outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; and where
    we had thought to be [alone](/wiki/Solitude "Solitude"), we shall be
    with all the [world](/wiki/World "World").**
    -   Chapter 1

<!-- -->

-   The happy ending is justly scorned as a misrepresentation; for the
    world, as we know it, as we have seen it, yields but one ending;
    death, disintegration, dismemberment, and the crucifixion of our
    heart with the passing of the forms which we have loved.
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   This death to the logic of emotional commitments of our chance
    moment in the world of space and time, this recognition of, the
    shift of our emphasis to, the universal life that throbs and
    celebrates its victory in the very kiss of our own annihilation,
    this [*amor
    fati*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati "w:Amor fati"){.extiw},
    "love of fate," love of the fate that is inevitably death,
    constitutes the experience of the tragic art...
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   There is no make-believe about heaven, future bliss, and
    compensation, to alleviate the bitter majesty, but only utter
    darkness, the void of unfulfillment, to receive and eat back the
    lives that have been tossed forth from the womb only to fail.
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   No tribal rite has yet been recorded which attempts to keep winter
    from descending; on the contrary: the rites all prepare the
    [community](/wiki/Community "Community") to endure, together with
    the rest of [nature](/wiki/Nature "Nature"), the season of the
    terrible cold.
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   **Sober, modern Occidental judgement is founded on a total
    misunderstanding of the realities depicted in the fairy tale, the
    myth, and the divine [comedies](/wiki/Comedy "Comedy") of
    [redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_(theology) "w:Redemption (theology)"){.extiw}.
    These, in the ancient world, were regarded as of a higher rank than
    [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy "w:Tragedy"){.extiw},
    of a deeper truth, of a more difficult realization, of a sounder
    structure, and of a revelation more complete.**
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   **The happy ending of the fairy tale, the myth, and the divine
    comedy of the soul, is to be read, not as a contradiction, but as a
    transcendence of the universal tragedy of man.** ...Tragedy is the
    shattering of the forms and of our attachment to the forms... **the
    two are the terms of a single mythological theme... the down-going
    and the up-coming**
    ([*kathados*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cathode#Etymology "wiktionary:cathode"){.extiw}
    and
    [*anodos*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anode#Etymology "wiktionary:anode"){.extiw}),
    **which together constitute the totality of the revelation that is
    life, and which the individual must know and love if he is to be
    purged**
    ([*katharsis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis "w:Catharsis"){.extiw}=[*purgatorio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory "w:Purgatory"){.extiw})
    of the contagion of sin (disobedience to the divine will) and death
    (identification with the mortal form).
    -   Campbell follows with a quote from [Ovid's](/wiki/Ovid "Ovid")
        [*Metamorposes*](/wiki/Ovid#Metamorphoses_.28Transformations.29 "Ovid"),
        "All things are changing; nothing dies..."
    -   Chapter 2

<!-- -->

-   **The passage of the mythological hero** may be overground,
    incidentally; fundamentally it **is inward—into depths where obscure
    resistances are overcome, and long lost, forgotten powers are
    revivified, to be made available for the transfiguration of
    the world. ...Something of the light that blazes invisible within
    the abysses of its normally opaque materiality breaks forth, with an
    increasing uproar. The dreadful mutilations are then seen as
    shadows, only, of an immanent, imperishable eternity; time yields to
    glory; and the world sings with the prodigious, angelic, but perhaps
    finally monotonous, siren music of the spheres. Like happy families,
    the myths and the worlds redeemed are all alike.**
    -   Chapter 2
-   (...) we today (in so far as we are unbelievers, or, if believers,
    in so far as **our inherited beliefs fail to represent the real
    problems of contemporary life**) must face alone, or, at best, with
    only tentative, impromptu, an not often very effective guidance.
    **This is our problem as modern 'enlightened' individuals, for whom
    all gods and devils have been rationalized out of existence**.
    -   Chapter 2, page 87 (New World Library, 2008)

<!-- -->

-   **Everywhere**, no matter what the sphere of interest (whether
    religious, political, or personal), **the really creative acts are
    represented as those deriving from some sort of dying to the
    world**; and what happens in the interval of the hero's nonentity,
    so that he comes back as one reborn, made great and filled with
    creative power, mankind is also unanimous in declaring. **We shall
    have only to follow**, therefore, **a multitude of heroic figures
    through the classic stages** of the universal adventure in order
    **to see again what has always been revealed. ...the singleness of
    the human spirit in its aspirations, powers, vicissitudes,
    and wisdom.**
    -   Chapter 3

<!-- -->

-   For when scrutinized in terms not of what it is but of how it
    functions, of how it has served [mankind](/wiki/Mankind "Mankind")
    in the past, of how it may serve today, mythology shows itself to be
    as amenable as life itself to the obsessions and requirements of the
    individual, the race, the age. 
    -   Epilogue

<!-- -->

-   The tribal ceremonies of birth, initiation, marriage, burial,
    installation, and so forth, serve to translate the individual’s
    life-crises and life-deeds into classic, impersonal forms. They
    disclose him to himself, not as this personality or that, but as the
    warrior, the bride, the widow, the priest, the chieftain; at the
    same time rehearsing for the rest of the community the old lesson of
    the archetypal stages.
    -   Epilogue

<!-- -->

-   **Wherever the hero may wander, whatever he may do, he is ever in
    the presence of his own essence — for he has the perfected eye
    to see. There is no separateness.** Thus, just as the way of social
    participation may lead in the end to a realization of the All in the
    individual, so that of exile brings the hero to the Self in all.
    -   Epilogue

<!-- -->

-   It is not only that there is no hiding place for the
    [gods](/wiki/Gods "Gods"){.mw-redirect} from the searching telescope
    and microscope; there is no such society any more as the gods
    once supported.
    -   Epilogue

<!-- -->

-   **The modern hero-deed must be that of questing to bring to
    [light](/wiki/Light "Light") again the lost Atlantis of the
    co-ordinated [soul](/wiki/Soul "Soul").**

    about the world, about how terrible it is?" And I say, "Yes, it's
    [great](/wiki/Great "Great"){.mw-redirect} the way it is" … I had
    the wonderful privilege of sitting face to face with \[a
    [Hindu](/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") guru\] and the first thing he

    answers questions... I said, "Yes, I have a question." I said, "
    Since in Hindu thinking all the
    [universe](/wiki/Universe "Universe") is divine, a manifestation of
    divinity itself, how can we say no to anything in the world? How can
    we say no to brutality to [stupidity](/wiki/Stupidity "Stupidity")

    his that that happened to be the first question he asked his guru,
    and we had a wonderful conversation for an hour there.

-   **Campbell:** **[Eternity](/wiki/Eternity "Eternity") isn't some
    later [time](/wiki/Time "Time"). Eternity isn't a long time.
    Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of
    [here and now](/wiki/Present "Present") which thinking and time
    cuts out. This is it. And if you don't get it here, you won't get
    it anywhere. And the experience of eternity right here and now is
    the function of [life](/wiki/Life "Life").** There's a wonderful
    formula that the
    [Buddhists](/wiki/Buddhists "Buddhists"){.mw-redirect} have for the
    [Bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva "w:Bodhisattva"){.extiw},
    the one whose being (sattva) is illumination (bodhi), who realizes
    his identity with eternity and at the same time his participation
    in time. And the attitude is not to withdraw from the world when you
    realize how horrible it is, but to realize that this horror is
    simply the foreground of a [wonder](/wiki/Wonder "Wonder") and to
    come back and participate in it. "All life is
    [sorrowful](/wiki/Sorrow "Sorrow")" is the first Buddhist saying,
    and it is. It wouldn't be life if there were not temporality
    involved which is sorrow. Loss, loss, loss.\
    **Moyers:** That's a pessimistic note.\
    **Campbell:** Well, you have to say yes to it, you have to say it's
    [great](/wiki/Great "Great"){.mw-redirect} this way. It's the way
    [God](/wiki/God "God") intended it.

<!-- -->

-   **People say that what we're all seeking is a
    [meaning](/wiki/Meaning "Meaning") for life. I don't think that's
    what we're really seeking.** I think what we're seeking is an
    experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the
    purely physical plane will have resonance within our own innermost
    being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of
    being alive. That's what it's all finally about.
    -   Episode 2, Chapter 4

<!-- -->

-   **I think it's important to live life with a
    [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") of its

-   **Now, what is a myth? The dictionary definition of a myth would be
    stories about gods. So then you have to ask the next question: What
    is a god? A god is a personification of a motivating power or a
    value system that functions in human life and in the universe - the
    powers if your own body and of nature.**
    -   p\. 28

<!-- -->

-   **One thing that comes out in
    [myths](/wiki/Myths "Myths"){.mw-redirect} is that at the bottom of
    the abyss comes the [voice](/wiki/Voice "Voice") of salvation. The
    black moment is the moment when the real message of transformation
    is going to come. At the darkest moment comes the
    [light](/wiki/Light "Light").**
    -   Ch. 2 : The Journey Inward

<!-- -->

-   **Moyers:** Do you ever have the sense of... being helped by hidden
    [hands](/wiki/Hands "Hands")?\
    **Campbell:** [All](/wiki/All "All"){.mw-redirect} the
    [time](/wiki/Time "Time"). It is
    [miraculous](/wiki/Miracles "Miracles"). I even have a superstition
    that has grown on me as a result of invisible hands coming all the
    time — namely, that if you do follow your
    [bliss](/wiki/Bliss "Bliss") you put yourself on a kind of track
    that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the
    [life](/wiki/Life "Life") that you ought to be living is the one you
    are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are
    in your field of bliss, and they open
    [doors](/wiki/Doors "Doors"){.mw-redirect} to you. **I say, follow
    your bliss and don't be [afraid](/wiki/Fear "Fear"), and doors will
    open where you didn't know they were going to be.**
    -   p\. 120

<!-- -->

-   **The way to find out about your happiness is to keep your mind on
    those moments when you feel most happy, when you really are
    happy-not excited, not just thrilled, but deeply happy. This
    requires a little bit of self analysis. What is it that makes you
    happy? Stay with it, no matter what people tell you. This is what I
    call "following your bliss."**
    -   p.193

<!-- -->

-   **Moyers:** Unlike heroes such as
    [Prometheus](/wiki/Prometheus "Prometheus") or
    [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus "Jesus"), we're not going on our journey to save
    the [world](/wiki/World "World") but to save ourselves.\
    **Campbell:** But in doing that you save the world. The influence of
    a vital person vitalizes, there's no doubt about it. The world
    without [spirit](/wiki/Spirit "Spirit") is a
    [wasteland](/wiki/Desert "Desert").
    [People](/wiki/People "People"){.mw-redirect} have the notion of
    saving the world by shifting things around, changing the
    [rules](/wiki/Rules "Rules"), and who's on top, and so forth. No,
    no! Any world is a valid world if it's alive. The thing to do is to
    bring [life](/wiki/Life "Life") to it, and the only way to do that
    is to find in your own case where the life is and become
    alive yourself.

-   **The image of the [cosmos](/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") must change with
    the development of the [mind](/wiki/Mind "Mind") and
    [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"); otherwise, the mythic
    statement is lost, and man becomes dissociated from the very basis
    of his own religious [experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience").**
    [Doubt](/wiki/Doubt "Doubt") comes in, and so forth. **You must
    remember: all of the great traditions, and little traditions, in
    their own [time](/wiki/Time "Time") were scientifically correct.
    That is to say, they were correct in terms of the scientific image
    of that age.** So there must be a scientifically validated image.
    Now you know what has happened: our scientific field has separated
    itself from the religious field, or vice-versa. … **This divorce
    this is a fatal thing, and a very unfortunate thing, and a totally

-   We're in a freefall into future. We don't know where we're going.
    Things are changing so fast, and always when you're going through a
    long tunnel, anxiety comes along. And all you have to do to
    transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a
    voluntary act. It's a very interesting shift of perspective and
    that's all it is... joyful participation in the sorrows and

*Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with [Bill
Moyers](/wiki/Bill_Moyers "Bill Moyers")* PBS television series, Mystic
Fire Video (2001)
-   "**You're talking about a search for the [meaning of
    life](/wiki/Meaning_of_life "Meaning of life")?**" I asked. **"No,
    no, no," he said. "For the
    [experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") of being alive."**
    -   [Bill Moyers](/wiki/Bill_Moyers "Bill Moyers"), in the
        Introduction

<!-- -->

-   **To him [mythology](/wiki/Mythology "Mythology") was "the
    [song](/wiki/Song "Song") of the
    [universe](/wiki/Universe "Universe")," "the [music of the
    spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis "w:Musica universalis"){.extiw}"
    — [music](/wiki/Music "Music") we [dance](/wiki/Dance "Dance") to
    even when we cannot [name](/wiki/Name "Name"){.mw-redirect}
    the tune.**
    -   Bill Moyers, in the Introduction

<!-- -->

-   The beasts were seen as envoys from that other world, and Campbell
    surmised "a [magical](/wiki/Magical "Magical"){.mw-redirect},
    [wonderful](/wiki/Wonderful "Wonderful"){.mw-redirect} accord"
    growing between the hunter and the hunted, as if they were locked in
    a "[mystical](/wiki/Mystical "Mystical"){.mw-redirect},
    [timeless](/wiki/Timeless "Timeless"){.mw-redirect}" cycle of
    [death](/wiki/Death "Death"), burial, and resurrection. Their
    [art](/wiki/Art "Art") — the
    [paintings](/wiki/Paintings "Paintings"){.mw-redirect} on cave walls
    — and oral [literature](/wiki/Literature "Literature") gave form to
    the impulse we now call [religion](/wiki/Religion "Religion").
    -   Bill Moyers, in the Introduction

<!-- -->

-   **The images of [God](/wiki/God "God") are many, he said, calling
    them "the masks of eternity" that both cover and reveal "the
    [Face](/wiki/Face "Face"){.mw-redirect} of
    [Glory](/wiki/Glory "Glory")."** … However the
    [mystic](/wiki/Mystic "Mystic"){.mw-redirect} traditions differ, he
    said, they are in accord in calling us to a deeper
    [awareness](/wiki/Awareness "Awareness") of the very act of
    living itself. **The unpardonable [sin](/wiki/Sin "Sin"), in
    Campbell's [book](/wiki/Book "Book"){.mw-redirect}, was the sin of
    inadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake.**
    -   Bill Moyers, in the Introduction

<!-- -->

-   **The new discoveries of [science](/wiki/Science "Science") "rejoin
    us to the ancients"** by enabling us to recognize in this whole
    [universe](/wiki/Universe "Universe") "a reflection magnified of our
    own most inward [nature](/wiki/Nature "Nature"); **so that we are**
    indeed its ears, its [eyes](/wiki/Eyes "Eyes"), its
    [thinking](/wiki/Thinking "Thinking"){.mw-redirect}, and its
    [speech](/wiki/Speech "Speech") — or, in theological terms, **God's
    ears, God's eyes, God's thinking, and God's
    [Word](/wiki/Word "Word"){.mw-redirect}.**"
    -   Bill Moyers, in the Introduction

<!-- -->

-   When he said that [myths](/wiki/Myths "Myths"){.mw-redirect} are
    clues to our deepest spiritual potential, able to lead us to
    delight, illumination, and even rapture, he spoke as one who had
    been to the places he was inviting others to visit.
    -   Bill Moyers, in the Introduction

<!-- -->

-   **He was a man with a thousand
    [stories](/wiki/Stories "Stories"){.mw-redirect}. This was one of
    his favorites.** In Japan for an international conference on
    religion, Campbell overheard another American delegate, a social
    philosopher from New York, say to a Shinto priest, "We've been now
    to a good many ceremonies and have seen quite a few of your shrines.
    But I don't get your [ideology](/wiki/Ideology "Ideology"). I don't
    get your [theology](/wiki/Theology "Theology")." **The Japanese**
    \[Shinto priest\] paused as though in deep
    [thought](/wiki/Thought "Thought") and then **slowly shook his head.
    "I think we don't have ideology," he said. "We don't have theology.
    We dance." And so did Joseph Campbell — to the music of
    the spheres.**
