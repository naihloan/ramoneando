# A non neutral gender experience

I get home late in the night. Baby of 8 months is already sleeping. I go to the bathroom while I notice that in the bottom of the toilet there are several used paper towels inside: wet, white and spread against the material. 

I see that the pee comes out in a clear color but when it reaches to the toilet paper and accumulates a little bit it becomes more yellowish and dark. In running laymen language this means a slight dehydration.

The curious event is that I had noticed this kind of de-coloration before but only in extreme conditions of lack of water. Now I learn that a mild situation can still be detected when putting some element in contrast into the situation. I imagine that not many woman have the chance to notice this on the go, in a easy and natural way.
