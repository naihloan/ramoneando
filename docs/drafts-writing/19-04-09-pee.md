# Pee | A non-neutral gender experience

I get home late in the night. The eight months old baby is already sleeping. I go to the bathroom. I notice that at the bottom of the toilet, there are several used paper towels inside: wet, white, and spread against the material, above water level, not floating. 

I do what I need to do, #1. I see that the pee comes out in clear color. But when it reaches the toilet paper, it accumulates a little bit on the soft transparent material, and the color of the urine appears more yellowish and dark. In running laymen language this means I am under slight dehydration.

The unusual event is that I had noticed this kind of de-coloration before but only in extreme conditions of lack of water. Now I learn that a mild situation can still be detected when putting some element in contrast to the situation. I imagine that not many women, nor men, have had the chance to notice this on the go, quickly and naturally. Could other novelties be discovered upon these everyday situations?
