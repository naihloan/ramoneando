This Is Why It's Nearly Impossible to Study Pain
================================================

scientists.

Imagine you have been asked to define pain by your doctor. [They might
have
asked](https://vitalrecord.tamhsc.edu/how-to-talk-to-your-doctor-about-pain/)
for a rating on a scale from zero, no pain, to 10, unbearable pain. Or
you chose from a selection of faces ranging from happy to tearful. Maybe
you answer with your words and gestures. You may have even drawn on a
human outline found in your intake paperwork to illustrate the pain's
presence in your body.

Where does it hurt? How do you *feel*? The enormous number of questions
a provider can ask reflects the many variables that are important for
treating pain. It also makes clear that communication about pain is
[difficult](https://massivesci.com/articles/what-is-palliative-care-hospice-care-chronic-back-pain/)
for both patients and providers. Pain is
[subjective](https://www.iasp-pain.org/terminology?navItemNumber=576#Pain)
and no two experiences are alike. And, a fundamental understanding of
what pain actually is has evaded science.

This is despite the establishment of [numerous
foundations](https://www.iasp-pain.org/Organizations?navItemNumber=679)
dedicated to its study, like the International Association for the Study
of Pain (or IASP), and the fact that nearly [20
percent](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6736a2.htm) of the
United States is struggling with chronic pain. Pain's successful escape
from our grasp is due, in part, to the fact that laboratory science does
not, and may not be able to, actually study pain psychology,
[beliefs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6492285/pdf/EJP-23-15.pdf),
and
[expectations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696024/) in
animals.

In fact, we're very careful to say in animal studies that we don't study
pain at all. We study "[pain-like
behaviors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15165744)" after inducing
an injury. The [ethical
limitations](http://nas-sites.org/animal-pain/how-to-recognize-pain-in-animals/)
of such procedures are constantly evaluated so as to only induce the
needed amount of "stimulus" for the purposes of an experiment. We infer
from the animal's behavior that they are experiencing pain arising from
something called
[nociception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964977/)
(the phenomenon of turning a harmful stimulus, like touching a hot
stove, into a signal the body can use to avoid tissue damage). But how
can we learn if something is truly painful to an animal if we can't
speak with them?

[Jennifer R. Deuis](https://imb.uq.edu.au/profile/398/jennifer-deuis), a
professor at the University of Queensland Institute for Molecular
Bioscience in Australia, and her colleagues wrote [a
paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2017.00284/full)
in a 2017 issue of *Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience* that discusses
how we investigate pain perception in lab animals through reflexes,
voluntary movements, and emotional changes in animals.

The authors discuss tests that look at reflexive responses to
potentially harmful stimuli like too much pressure or excessive heat.
The hind paw is the location best understood and most often stimulated
for investigating these reflexes in animals. The idea is that there is a
certain amount of "painful" stimuli an animal can tolerate and, when
that threshold is reached, the animal quickly withdraws its limb.
Regardless of what test is used, it's important to find a baseline
threshold that causes a reflex behavior.

Once the baseline is found, the researcher then induces an injury and
the tests are performed again. In response to the injury, the threshold
drops. This new, lower threshold is a condition known as
[allodynia](https://www.iasp-pain.org/terminology?navItemNumber=576#Allodynia).
The [IASP defines
it](https://www.iasp-pain.org/terminology?navItemNumber=576#Allodynia)
as "pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain." Think
of a pleasant shower becoming painful after getting sunburned. The
successful treatment of this condition is one of the foremost
foundations upon which all new pain relieving treatments are built upon.

Finally, a treatment, such as a new drug or exercise therapy, is given
and the tests are performed one last time. If the threshold rises back
to baseline or near baseline levels, the therapy has alleviated the
paw's allodynia and therefore successfully treated a key component of
pain perception. But treating pain in animals does not necessarily treat
it in
[humans](https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(00)01502-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0165614700015029%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
For example, a couple of decades ago, a class of compounds called NK1
receptor antagonists were found to be effective in rodents and hailed as
a potential breakthrough in pain care. When clinical trials were
performed, however, Merck Pharmaceutical researchers that helped develop
the drug were
[dismayed](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-18891-6_13#enumeration)
to find that "the outcome from clinical trials \[was\] extremely
disappointing with no clear analgesic efficacy." The drugs [simply
failed](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2005/08/25/the_painful_history_of_substance_p)
in humans.

A newer approach to evaluate the subjective nature of pain in animals is
the "[grimace scale](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/grimacescales)," which
aims to mimic the kinds of facial changes people make when experiencing
different magnitudes of pain. Changes in the animal's facial features
are scored based on how increased stimuli yield differences in their
facial expression. Unfortunately, this test is limited not only because
nociceptive stimuli and some chronic pain models are not
[associated](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1455) with facial
changes but also due to the fact that a human observer or human coded
computer is the judge of severity.

This kind of technology may be especially difficult to ethically use
given that
[gender](https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://scholar.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1144&context=fac_pubs)
and
[race](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/pdf/pnas.201516047.pdf)
have been shown to
[bias](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300621)
practitioner beliefs about, and therefore treatment of, pain. Any
algorithm that describes a pain "score" could be incomplete and used
[unfairly](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612876/this-is-how-ai-bias-really-happensand-why-its-so-hard-to-fix/).
Pre-clinincal pain science itself has failed to investigate pain
differences between males and females equally and many of the drugs
currently in use were developed using [predominantly male animal
models](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6443/825). It wasn't
until 2016 that female mice were required to be included in these
studies. All patients could be
[suffering](https://www.wired.com/story/womens-pain-is-different-from-mens-the-drugs-could-be-too/)
as a result of failing to be inclusive of [all
sexes](https://massivesci.com/articles/sex-gender-intersex-transgender-identity-discrimination-title-ix/).

Despite these sophisticated experiments, scientists still struggle with
other components of pain in animals: beliefs and expectations. How do
you evaluate those things in a rat? It's been shown that beliefs may
sometimes bring
[more](https://www.nature.com/news/strong-placebo-response-thwarts-painkiller-trials-1.18511)
relief than medicines can. There have been calls to study human pain [in
all its complexity](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04994-5).
Perhaps we humans won't be able to translate mice and rats' experiences
of pain until we discover more ways to understand them without our
self-centered biases.
