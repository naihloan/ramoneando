Hi Leslie! I am publishing a book from Spanish, already published, and now translated to English: 33,000 words, by several authors. It's for an NGO (Green Drinks) that works on sustainable topics. Could I request an estimate on how much you'd charge to proof-read that material? Many thanks in advance.

Hello, Benjamin. Thanks for reaching out.  To answer your question I'd first need to know if (1) you're assuming that the book as written is in good shape and that someone would only be checking to make sure the translation is sound and there are no errors anywhere or (2) the book content in itself also needs reviewing and editing. To be honest, the first option of straight proofing--checking for typing errors and spelling, etc.--is several levels below what I do, so you'd probably be better off contacting freelance proofreaders. But if you're hoping for someone to read your manuscript and proof while also editing for both content and paragraph/sentence structure, I'd be willing to take a look at your manuscript and give you a quote. You're welcome to attach a file to this message. Hope this helps!

Best wishes,
Leslie

 Hi Leslie! I think the second option you mention would be a good option, the only point is that this would be with little to no contact with the authors. Does this seem right? The translation has not yet begun, but I am sending the Spanish version. Please let me know how much you believe could cost to review once translated, yes? Many thanks!

Hello, again. First, to answer your question, since the book is already written, there shouldn't be any issue large enough that I'd need to correspond with any of the authors (although I'd contact you if any pressing question arose). So that's fine.

That said, I skimmed through the book, and for a light line edit and copy edit for a project of this length, I would charge $800. This would be payable through PayPal with their fee of $24.18. So the total invoice would be for $824.18, to be paid when I began the project.

If this is something that works for you, we can discuss a timeline, and I can send a contract. If not, that's fine. Just let me know. No matter what happens, I appreciate the work you all are doing. My daughter is in college majoring in environmental policy and sociology, and I'm president of a community-building organization, so initiatives such as these are important to us.

Best,
Leslie

 Hello Leslie, your proposal looks solid. Let me discuss the timeline possibilities with the rest of the team and come back. I do have two concerns on the payment: 1. Is it possible to pay through other methods? This is because the foundation paying can't move money outside the bank as far as I know. 2. Is it possible to pay some portion at the beginning, and then later upon end? Fell free to respond via email: benjaminjuarezarlt@greendrinkscba.org. Many thanks!!
