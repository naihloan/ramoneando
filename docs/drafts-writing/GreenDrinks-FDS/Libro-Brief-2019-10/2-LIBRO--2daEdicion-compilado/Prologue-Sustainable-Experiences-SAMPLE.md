Prologue
========

A group of volunteers produces eco-bricks by reusing plastic bottles that were thrown away in a city in Córdoba, Argentina.
In another city, there is an NGO that recollects monthly, all by its own, seven tons (of kilograms) of paper. These are re-purposed for recycling, so instead of remaining as garbage, they become a resource.
In another town, further South, a businessperson insists on -even though the income budget does not come square-
manufacturing truly bio-degradable bags, with no plastic supplies.
In several mountain range sites, there are eco-friendly touristic ventures,
that aim to reduce the impact over the environment and landscape.
More to the North, several groups put up a fight to reforest the mountains that have lost native species.
Further East, a town came up with the goal to become those who separate most garbage,
and already 75% of the neighbors sort home wastes,
at the same time that hundreds of mayors repeat -without even trying- that it is too hard.
And the list goes on and on.

It is likely that Córdoba, just as the country and the planet, is nowadays facing the most massive environmental dilemmas of its history. Paradoxically, it is quite sure that there were never as many people (although not enough) building actions and projects to defend the eco-system. A reminding goal for those individual and group efforts is to get transformed to a larger scale into social phenomenons. And above all, that they impose onto the political and economic agenda that rules the world. All the same, there will be no way that the grand environmental topics become State politics if they do not start from social consciousness. This push should be -also- born from people, groups, and communities who push forward committed efforts.

That is what these stories narrate.
Green Drinks selected them for this book
as a token of the contributions and pursuits of restless people that
have produced different sustainable experiences that transform their environment.
Gaylord Nelson once made this consideration:
“The most critical topic about the environment is rarely mentioned: our culture’s lack of ethics.”
The quotation seems destined to fit into the narrations of the 16 testimonies that make up this volume.

A hotel manager put forward an environmental-friendly touristic project and said:
“Some time ago, when the word ‘sustainable’ did not exist,
our parents and grandparents talked about ‘doing things right ‘”.
In some way, that “call for duty” works as the simplest explanation of the importance that as humans we go forward, but sustainably, because we are using earth, “borrowed” from our children, from the coming generation.

The debate around sustainability, to grow in terms of social consciousness and become massive,
requires at this time that the discussion on the defense of the environment focus not only on a romantic vision, on the green, love of nature, a conservationist or even idyllic approach.
For the debate to blossom and become crucial in the public agenda,
the smartest angle should aim to show how being detached from the environment has an impact on people’s lives: here and now. There are abundant examples to illustrate this argument.

The experiences that narrate here –some among many possible–,
can serve as triggers, as models that inspire and motivate,
as markers of what each one of us can do (and not only saying)
to bet for sustainable development.
When they are all gathered together, they acquire another dimension.

The contribution that these texts bring forward, as other divulgation actions do,
is to impulse the debate of these topics to regenerate ideas,
open up views and perspectives, re-think solutions and alternatives,
share concerns, and spread enthusiasm.
