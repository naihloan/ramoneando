Hi Leslie! I am publishing a book from Spanish, already published, and now translated to English: 33,000 words, by several authors. It's for an NGO (Green Drinks) that works on sustainable topics. Could I request an estimate on how much you'd charge to proof-read that material? Many thanks in advance.

Hello, Benjamin. Thanks for reaching out.  To answer your question I'd first need to know if (1) you're assuming that the book as written is in good shape and that someone would only be checking to make sure the translation is sound and there are no errors anywhere or (2) the book content in itself also needs reviewing and editing. To be honest, the first option of straight proofing--checking for typing errors and spelling, etc.--is several levels below what I do, so you'd probably be better off contacting freelance proofreaders. But if you're hoping for someone to read your manuscript and proof while also editing for both content and paragraph/sentence structure, I'd be willing to take a look at your manuscript and give you a quote. You're welcome to attach a file to this message. Hope this helps!

Best wishes,
Leslie

 Hi Leslie! I think the second option you mention would be a good option, the only point is that this would be with little to no contact with the authors. Does this seem right? The translation has not yet begun, but I am sending the Spanish version. Please let me know how much you believe could cost to review once translated, yes? Many thanks!
