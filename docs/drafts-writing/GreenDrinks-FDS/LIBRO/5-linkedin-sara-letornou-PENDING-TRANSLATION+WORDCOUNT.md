Hi Sara! I am publishing a book from Spanish, already published, and now translated to English: 33,000 words, by several authors. It's for an NGO (Green Drinks) that works on sustainable topics. How much would you charge to proof-read that material? Many thanks in advance.

 Hi Benjamin! 

 Thanks for reaching out to me. I would need to review a few sample pages of the manuscript to know for certain. Is this something you would be willing to do? That way, when I've finished the sample, you can see my style as a proofreader and determine whether I'm the right fit for your project.

 If you're still interested, please send me an email at sara@heartofthestoryeditorial.com with the sample pages attached as an MS Word document. (If it's possible, would you mind sending 3 or 4 pages from the beginning of the manuscript and 3 or 4 from the end?) Also, in the same email, could you let me know the schedule/deadline for completing the proofread, any budget limitations, and the process you went through to translate the original manuscript from Spanish into English.

 I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. 

 Best,
 Sara
