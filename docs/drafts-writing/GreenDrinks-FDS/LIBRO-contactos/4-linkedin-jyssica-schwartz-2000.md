Similar budget to translation. Roughly $2,000 dollars

Jyssica! I am publishing a book from Spanish, already published, and now  translated to English: 33,000 words, by several authors. It's for an NGO that works on sustainable topics. How much would you charge to proof-read that material? Many thanks in advance.

 Hi, Benjamin. I charge 9 cents per word for editing. In this case, it won't just be proofreading, it will be full editing because translation software is never great, there will need to be wording and sentence fixing, too.

  If you had it professionally translated and they did as much as they could for grammar, I can do 6 cents per word for copywriting and proofreading.
