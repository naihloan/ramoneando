Hi Andrea,
Long-time, no see. I hope you are doing well. On my side, I've been running slow with my Ph.D. I advanced with my literature review and prepared some approaches for fieldwork, but yet need to do interviews. And with the baby, I am very happy but also slowed down quite a bit. On the other hand, I haven't been emailing you much but I'd like to hear from you, I hope I can make it to a summer camp retreat one of the following years, or meet up under some other circumstance. I'm sure it'll happen sooner or later.

Now, let me tell you why I'm reaching out now. I am working in Argentina under a foundation that works with sustainability topics and reaching up to the community. We have already published a book in Spanish with several community authors and now we want to publish the book in English. It is not an academic work, rather a reach to the general public. I am sending a review of the book in Spanish if this helps you out as an overview.

> Would you be interested in (co-)publishing this book in English? Or would you know who could find it interesting? Or suggest a (freelance) reviewer/copy-editor/proof-editor for the translation?

In any case, it's a great thing to say Hi. I hope all goes on very well.
Very best wishes,
Benji.
