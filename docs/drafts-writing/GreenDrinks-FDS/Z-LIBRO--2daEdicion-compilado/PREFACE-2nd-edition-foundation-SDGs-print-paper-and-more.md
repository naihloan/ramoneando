# We'll be back

It's the second time that we're publishing this book. We like it and the innovation that it means locally pushes us forward. But we're not all the same, nor can we nor do we want totally to be coherent, simple and final. So let's discuss where we find ourselves and where we'd like to go towards. From idea to action, trying to avoid paralysis midway. So lets move on.

We've decided to publish this book in a new material: Stone Paper.
The old and still current conventional paper is made with cellulose: from wood and sugar cane.
Allegedly, stone paper will use less water, energy, and leave less of a carbon footprint in comparison to the traditional papers.
But, are the more variables to consider if stone paper is an eco-material?

This new paper material is also not available around the world, so this text needed to rely on a producer located in Taiwan. What are the environmental consequences of bringing a material from so far apart? We have already got into the numbers of how much contamination the old companies produce.

CHART comparing stone paper & other papers

Mineral paper can be much less contaminating than its rivals. But: how can we know that this material is any good at all? We can't even begin to understand what are its components and how it's made. According to the company [producing](https://www.stone-paper.com/en/faq/) it: Stone Paper is 80% mineral limestone (which appears to be one of the most abundant resources in Earth), and 20% bio-polyethylene resin (HDPE). That begins to sound like a novel idea to pay attention to: be it to reassure that all is good with it, or to suspect if it may not be a good ecological choice.

Lets leave the discussion about plastic in suspense. Can using plastic be OK?

> * What would happen, as an exercise of imagination, if all of the books in the world were made of Stone Paper? Could this be a good thing because they contaminated less when produced? What would happen if they all needed to be disposed of? Could they return back to Earth with ease?
> * That is a very '80s way to think!! Instead of thinking about the negative externalities of the capitalist system, we should rather think in a more current way. That is, nowadays we should look at a product taking into account its full life cycle, from production, to consumer, and way back into the system. All of this pondered from the beginning, when designing an object, before introducing it into the population. And I could go on and on with this: it's all about the circular economy. Let me check a book and come back: Thomas Friedman's *Hot, flat and crowded. Why we need a green revolution* (2008).

# What harm do we do when we produce, but more importantly:

# What good can we do as a new way of life

Everyday we hear that there's a new thing in society that is not produced by biological causes, but by culture. This argument has of course exaggerations but also offers balance in analysis. One can find well explained phenomenons that consider all factors that produce a situation.

So an interesting hypothesis is that the Amazon rainforest is not a natural place, but rather was an environment created by the pre-colombine societies. 



# Shipping, deciding, distributing, acting

So we're using a new material and we're happy to try this new path. But is it in fact such a good idea? It turns out that the novel paper is brought all the way from Taiwan. The paper is shipped over through to South America, and being first distributed between Argentina, Chile, and from there on elsewhere. The English version is expected to move around other hemispheres and could be a novelty through the anglophone audience, since we understand that cases of sustainability from the South are rare. And we expect to cover this gap by allowing Argentinian social workers, entrepreneurs, statesmen and academics to speak about their experiences.

It is not with total assertiveness that we are taking this path. But we are taking a path, and it's a risk. And we want to learn and move forward. This, we have found, is one of the green challenges ahead. It appears that if you try to act upon a moral or environmental or justice standard, you may feel paralyzed. That path would to not speak avoiding the chance to offend someone, or not consume anything because everything that we use produces an excess, or not being able to do something because energy is consumed and not used for all, and all choices have some cost. Lets just assume this and see what are the available options, and move on.

Doing good upon our environment is not as easy as ABC. We can't simply change a single material and pat ourselves on the shoulder as such a big accomplishment. The way ahead would seem to be more of step by step process, a small and gradual change, not from one day to the next.
