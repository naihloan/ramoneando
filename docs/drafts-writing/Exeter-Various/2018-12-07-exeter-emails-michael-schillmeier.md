Dear BEnji, 

please have a close look at this email. It is about your upgrade, which is a major milestone in your PhD process. 

I would appreciate if you could send a brief outline of what you have done the last couple of months and how you are doing. 

I would also appreciate that we could meet this week briefly on skype to discuss the steps done, present ideas, issues and plans ahead.  

BEst wishes

Michael. 


PS
I will not send this email to Mike Michael since he is recovering from a mild heart attack he suffered last week.
