The internet is littered with information on what makes a good SOP, but
I would like to ask a specific question regarding mentioning one's
research interests in SOP.

What points should a student keep in mind while writing her statement of
purpose? If there is exactly one specific professor the student is
targeting, it makes sense to talk of one of his recent papers and ideas
for extending its results in the SOP.

-   If 1) there are a couple of preferred professors or more, 2) each of
    them has multiple research interests and 3) the student is unable to
    zero in on a field or topic, how should the student tailor her SOP
    to make it appealing to more than one professor?
-   Should the student worry about the feasibility of her ideas in the
    SOP? Is an extensive literature survey in the relevant field
    necessary before putting anything in the SOP?

Your research statement (not "statement of purpose" as university
administrators strangely insist on calling it) should be a description
of *your* research experience, interests, and goals, as a supporting
case for *your* potential for *independent* research. If you were
applying to work in my research area, I would much rather read about
*your* research ideas than mine.

Here's what I like to see in research statements:

-   **What have you already done?** What problems have you solved, or at
    least worked on? What independent projects have you been part of?
    What were your key contributions? What did you learn? What did you
    teach the world? How do your results compare to what was already
    known? What original ideas are you most proud of? Be specific,
    technical, credible, and confident (but not arrogant). Refer the
    reader to your web page for more details. Have a web page with more
    details: preprints, project reports, source code, videos, etc.

-   **What are you working on now?** What problems are you currently trying to solve? What are you currently trying to build? What are the open research issues? What intellectual tools are you using, or learning to use? What are you reading? What prior results are you building on? How are you building on your own earlier work? **What is your current favorite half-baked idea?** Be specific, technical, credible, and confident (but not arrogant). If you have partial results, refer the reader to your web page for more details. Have a web page with more details.

You ask whether you should worry about the feasibility of your ideas. No
more or less than if you were actually doing research. Ideally, I'd like
to see both that you have good ideas and that you're not afraid to have
bad ones.

-   **What might you want to work on in the future?** What problems you
    would like to solve? What would you like to build? Do you want to
    push your existing projects further? If so, how? What new areas are
    you interested in exploring? What are your long-term career goals?
    Convince the reader that you are knowledgeable about your target
    area(s), but be honest about your ignorance. Be specific, credible,
    and confident (but not arrogant).

No one will hold you to your stated plans. You don't need to do an
extensive literature survey (although it certainly can't hurt; put a
copy on your web page), but at a minimum you should have had a strong
undergraduate course on the topic.

-   **How does my department fit your research goals?** (If the rest of
    your statement is well-written, the reader already knows the answer
    to this question, but you also need convince the reader that *you*
    know.)

A few sentences about motivation are worthwhile, but don't talk about
how many programming languages you know, or about how you were a child
prodigy, or how many [contests you've
won](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1177/are-participations-in-competitions-well-recognized-for-a-ph-d-application),
or how many A+s you got, or how Alan Turing was your childhood hero, or
how your research area will Change The World. Write in simple, direct,
flawless English. Like Suresh, I have seen many phrases like "my first
trembling steps", but never in successful applications.

The only credible reason to "target a particular professor" is if that
professor's research interests *already* mirror your own. If you try to
craft the bulk of your statements to different professors in different
departments, the result will be much shallower, and therefore much less
persuasive, than if you describe your own well-developed research
interests.

Yes, that means you have to *have* well-developed research interests.
That's the point.
