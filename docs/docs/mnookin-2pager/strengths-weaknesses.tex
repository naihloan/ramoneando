% Believer,
%  Philomath,
%  Coach,

%  Strategist
 \item[Believer] in:
 people's capabilities.
 We can all bring a lot to the table.
%  from both a work and personal view.
%  self, others, team, company.
 This viewpoint makes me high drive, and persistent.

a single eternal answer.

% The important thing is not to stop questioning%
% – Albert Einstein
% The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.
% Iteration and nuance are key.
\item[Coach/Supportive.] I push causes to happen, and I believe we can all give something out to the world. wagmi: we're all gonna make it.
\item[Self-Believer/Ownership.] I believe to have both confidence and certainty to move forward, and I strive for other people to gain them as well.
\item[Strategist.] Always aiming for the big picture: am I going to be happy about this work in 20 to 50/200 years? I hope so. Let's plan steps and execute!

% \subsection*{Weaknesses}
%
% \noindent
% My areas to improve come from Personality overall:
% INTJ
% +
% Type 5 / Wing 4
%
% \begin{description}
%  \item[Contrarian:] sometimes wrongly, :P
%  \item[] \> \> \>
%  I believe in people's intent and their heart-felt beliefs and actions. At the same time,
%  I can disagree with their ideas and perspectives,
%  and it's a challenge to communicate both angles.
%  \item[Interruptor:] a fine art that ought never be learned :P \\
%  I get excited about a conversation and want to contribute. Video calls do help with this:
%  because you have to unmute, and really
%  check if the other person is OK and wrapped their idea.
%  \item[Overly Imaginative:] going off rail to derivatives can be unproductive for working on immediate goals. Let's better plan one step at a time to stay in sync
%  \item[Data insufficient:] I'm biased to teamwork and intuition. It's OK to build quickly and iterate, but
%  it's best to plan strategies with hard-data.
%  It's one of my next steps, but not there yet.
% \item[Stakeholder Influence.] Even though I feel in general to have good relationships across teams, I may need to review what my leverage is, and how much I can or should influence across company.
%  \end{description}

%  \item[Unexperienced Professional Background:] no well-known, big-name company on my resume as an employer. Primary experience in unstructured companies, mostly regional, in LatinAmerica, and in a promising Music Startup (with HQ in US and Europe) but that hasn't yet gained traction.
