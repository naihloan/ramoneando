============

**Start** \[00:00:01.8\]

**End** \[01:32:32.1\] 

**MILENA:** [00:00:01.8] It was a very nice climbing. When we went near the top, many condors went around... 

**Interviewer:** [00:00:08.3] How old is your son? 

**MILENA:** [00:00:10.0] Seven years. 

**Interviewer:** [00:00:12.5] Does he climb? 

**MILENA:** [00:00:14.5] Yes. He climbs. 

**Interviewer:** [00:00:17.4] How did you learn to climb? From your parents? 

**MILENA:** [00:00:21.6] Not me. I started climbing ... My family called me the cat. Because I always climbing trees, my grandma's wall, in the yard. And so, after that I started climbing with my cousin. She said: ah, there's a course, on climbing.

 [00:00:48.6] Let's go! 

**Interviewer:** [00:01:01.2] What did they think about you climbing Fitz Roy? 

**MILENA:** [00:01:03.9] Well ... They don't know! 

**Interviewer:** [00:01:11.0] Do you have many brothers? How many are you?

**MILENA:** [00:01:11.7] Yeah. I'm from my mother, the youngest. But I have other brother from my father. 

**Interviewer:** [00:01:29.9] Is there a difference in your state of mind when you hike like we are doing today? Compared to when you climb? What is the difference? 

**MILENA:** [00:01:45.6] Maybe when you are hiking you are thinking other things. Like maybe the quotidian, the daily things, and when you are climbing the mountains you are just right there right in the moment. You don't have things or worries, about your daily things, or the bank. 

 [00:02:18.4] Or that you have to call someone. No. You're just there. Because it's like your body, your mind, everything is just pushing you like to think: you're surviving. You're fighting for your life. You don't know if you're going to die in this moment. It's like this. It's not like something that I feel this. It's the truth. 

 [00:02:45.7] It's not like always are dropping rocks, whatever. It can be a perfect day. You can climb with a t-shirt, and maybe in a warm day. But you are also happy. It's not like you're serious and climbing like ... You're enjoying. But I mean, you have to be very focused on what you're doing. Because you have to use your hands, feet. You have to think how are you going to belay. 

 [00:03:20.4] When you climb sometimes you use your hands, or depends on the climbing. You can use ice axe, but well, you are going to belay, to belay your rope and you're going to belay your partner. 

 [00:03:45.2] There are people that goes and climb in solo. So they also have to belay themselves, or maybe sometimes just climb without rope. And then when they go down they use a rope for rappelling down. But if you're climbing with a partner, so you have to also belay and give the other rope to go up. 

 [00:04:12.2] You can climb three persons or just only two. So, yes. You don't have space in your mind to think ... Bullshit. I think you couldn't. You have to use all your focus on what you're doing in this moment. So it's very different. 

 [00:04:47.5] Oh, I have to go the ... Shop! 

 [00:04:54.8] Well, but it's not ... You can have a very very good moment climbing, laughing and doing jokes. It's not like you're [doing strong inhalation] ... But when you're climbing in this moment you are just very focused. 

**Interviewer:** [00:05:27.2] Flow! You are immersed... 

**MILENA:** [00:05:40.4] It's like a kind of meditation. I did two times meditation. I went to a retreat. Vipasana, I told you before. And it's ... This kind of meditation is observe. You have to watch your feelings.

 [00:06:06.7] And well, when you are climbing, if you are doing like a very hard climbing, you are thinking. You are very focused. It's like you have to know what you are going to do. Perfectly. If you ...

 [00:06:33.7] When I climb after Alpine climbing I decided to do something because I am very like, active. I need to do activity. And so I started to climb high boulders, so I was trying ... I have a [heart project?], so I know if I put my finger a little bit into the left, or little bit more to the right, I couldn't grab very well. 

 [00:07:08.3] So this is like the ... Very specific! [like one centimetre] So you have to be very focused on that. 

**MILENA:** [00:07:30.3] This is for the cows too. 

 [00:08:26.9] They are not allowed but ... Well, they have like a kind of flexible permit with the owner of these cows. 

**Interviewer:** [00:08:42.2] The Park has a flexible permit with them? 

**MILENA:** [00:08:45.4] Well yes. Because they couldn't be taken out very easily. 

 [00:08:54.7] And now I hear that they are taking out all the cows in Perito Moreno Glacier. There is a branch lake that is called Brazo Rico. It's Rico Branch, from the Argentinian Lake, and there are many many cows there. So they couldn't control them and so now the rangers are killing them. 

**Interviewer:** [00:09:32.4] What is the cows into the valley area, and they actually [x]? 

**MILENA:** [00:09:45.0] Because they haven't got owners. Now they are wild cows. They are cow wild [feral]. And this is a problem. Because they are eating all the forest. And also they ...

 [00:10:12.1] It's hard to say in English, but they are pushing forward the huemules. Because they are stronger than huemules. Huemules is the deer from here. It's native from Patagonia. And we don't have much population of them. 

 [00:10:39.6] Be careful here. 

**Interviewer:** [00:10:50.1] I just needed the extra assurance of every step to be a safe one. 

**MILENA:** [00:10:57.0] Well done. 

 [00:11:02.0] So well, each time we are seeing more huemules than before. And it's because we were taking care of them. So there are some places are strict reserves that you couldn't go. Like Huemul Mountain, that is a place that you couldn't go, by yourself or whatever. Nobody can go there. It's strict.

**Interviewer:** [00:11:32.5] Is that a wild cow? 

**MILENA:** [00:11:34.8] Yeah. They are wild cows. Yes. 

**Interviewer:** [00:11:41.6] I hadn't heard about wild cows before! 

**MILENA:** [00:11:46.5] They are not very friendly. 

 [00:12:00.8] There was a problem in Perito Moreno Glacier. There was a scientist that he was studying there. He's one of the founders of the Glaciarium Museum. And he was studying there. He went many times to sleep there. 

 [00:12:26.7] And he was walking in the morning to go and take some measures of the glacier. And when he went out from the tent, a very big [wolf?] on top of him. And he fell. He was very hurt, from this [x]. And so after that the rangers noticed that and they went there and shot a few of them.

 [00:12:59.6] I remember this moment when the rangers shot them, these cows, they shot ... This [wool?] and other more[?]. They found it. And so the people from the shelter, they cut the meat and there was a cow that was pregnant, so they take out the ... How disgusting! 

 [00:13:30.2] I always remember because I'm a vegetarian. And so ... It was all so everything bloody. And all the ... Like a lot of meat. So everyday they were eating meat. Well, I was working there in the Perito Moreno Glacier for a while. 

**Interviewer:** [00:13:51.6] And so these cows have no owners? 

**MILENA:** [00:13:53.1] This one no. 

**Interviewer:** [00:13:55.0] They're just feral, wild ... 

**MILENA:** [00:13:56.5] And this one also ... No. Because they ... I don't know if all of them but maybe some of them have owners. It's because they went out from the fences. And they get wild. And look, this has got like an earring. 

 [00:14:57.6] Look at this bull, it's very big. 

 [00:15:02.7] That other one is so small! [speaking soft] Oh ... I couldn't eat these animals. They're very small ... 

 [00:15:34.8] There are some signs that say don't get close! 

 [00:16:50.4] A ton, at least! 

 [00:16:58.5] Attention. Wild cows area. If you meet with them, scream to scare them away. Don't be closer. If they get closer don't block the passage. And keep safe. 

 [00:17:49.7] I remember a few times, when I was working there as I told you, with the cows sometimes I slept there in the shelter. In Perito Moreno Glacier. And sometimes with the headlamp ... Aaaahh! I met with a cow and I was very afraid.

 [00:18:09.0] Like both [Other Ben says]

**MILENA:** [00:18:10.9] Yes! Drooling! Like staring at you. And then both screaming afraid. 

 [00:19:16.6] Now we can see Poincenot Mountain on the left. And on the right is part of Fitz Roy. 

 [00:20:07.0] Did you grab the peanuts and raisins? 

 [00:20:18.9] I think so [Ben2].  

**MILENA:** [00:21:34.2] So we have ... A stream from here, to fill bottles. 

 [00:22:26.7] Now it's going to be ... Do you want to fill bottles? 

**Interviewer:** [00:22:30.9] Here? 

**MILENA:** [00:22:37.0] I think that further on we have others. Not very far. And then in the way up. 

 [00:23:00.4] I've never seen cows here in the forest. They stay in this part. They've got good grass, there. 

 [00:23:34.2] I'm surprised that we didn't see orchids. In some other trails we still have them. 

 [00:24:40.0] This plant, these flowers are called calceolarias. And we call it topa-topa. Or lady slippers [capachito, zapatitos de Venus, zapatitos de la Virgen]. 

 [00:24:53.8] They remind me of Pokemon [Ben2]. 

**MILENA:** [00:29:04.3] There are many trekking around. You have the option to come from Laguna Torre, there is a zipline [tirolesa], a rope to cross the Fitz Roy River. So you have to use a harness. And then you connect with these hill and go to Toro. 

**Interviewer:** [00:30:24.0] What is this, do you know? [holes in trees]

**MILENA:** [00:30:26.2] The woodpeckers. The woodpeckers look for ... Or maybe when it was old ... But these trees are attacked by termites, and bacteria. You can find some trees that are hollow inside because they make a reaction to keep alive, and so they get empty in the middle.

 [00:31:16.3] Llao llaos [llaullao] are there, you can see them. This is a reaction of the tree to keep them away from the [x]. You can see that there are some yellow [bols?] ... This is a fungus, in the llao llao. And old man's beard [barba de viejo].

 [00:33:58.5] Empty trees in the middle. 

**Interviewer:** [00:33:58.5] Donuts tree. 

**MILENA:** [00:33:59.8] There are many bad trees in the forest. That's because ... Well, nobody takes the wood from the National Park. Maybe the rangers sometimes take them, or [leave them off the trail] or for a bank, or a bridge. 

**Interviewer:** [00:34:39.7] Is it the wind that kicks it down? 

**MILENA:** [00:34:41.8] Also wild fires. It's very dry and sometimes that makes it very dangerous. 

 [00:34:58.8] But we had only one fire at a time. In 2002, in the way to Laguna Torre, there was a small fire. Not very big like in Torres del Paine [Chile]: 10,000 hectares I think over there burned, 2012 or 2014. So sad. 

 [00:35:37.4] All of this area is post-glaciar forest. So the soil is not very deep. The roots [of the trees] are very superficial. Shallow. 

 [00:36:25.9] All of this area was covered by ice: 20,000 years ago. The last glaciation was 20,000 and so 1,000 metres above see level and 200 kilometres to the East, were covered by ice. 

 [00:36:48.4] All of this area near the lakes that are with rocks, of very big blocks, these blocks were carried by the glaciers. [...] And this is an old moraine, where we are walking now.

 [00:37:17.0] And it was a sea bed. That's why it's full of fossils. Because in the beginning it was a sea bed and then the place, 20 million years ago the Andes Range appeared, and after that the glaciation. Well, a lot of movement. 

 [00:37:48.7] And 20,000 years ago the glaciers pushed forward and [x] these moraines.

 [00:38:22.3] Look at the trees. They're getting smaller because we are winning altitude. 

[00:38:43.1] And also it's more exposed to the wind. So as soon as we reach more or less 1,000 metres we are going out of the forest. There is a little forest on the right ... 

 [00:39:16.3] The ground is different. The air, and everything is going different. 

 [00:40:36.6] I want to show you my secret place. Where I have my ... Rocks! [Fossils]

**Interviewer:** [00:42:17.5] Is there water coming up soon? 

**MILENA:** [00:42:19.9] Maybe here it's not so bad. Because the other one is not so close. Oh, there is water here. Look. This is muthi chaura. It's not impressive but you can eat them. 

**Interviewer:** [00:43:03.9] Like a cranberry. 

**MILENA:** [00:47:03.8] Do you want to take a break? Maybe we can sit there. 

**Interviewer:** [00:47:10.1] Maybe once we get to the water. 

**MILENA:** [00:48:46.0] These are Ranunculus acris [botones dorados], golden buttons. It's full of them. 

**Interviewer:** [00:49:10.6] Is this hollow?

**MILENA:** [00:49:11.3] Yeah. That's why I was saying that the mother rock is super close. [The root is close to the surface ... ]

 [00:51:10.8] [Speaks about work experience in other areas: cooking, waiting, as massage therapist]

 [00:53:47.9] Oh look. Here are the orchids. 

 [00:54:15.5] These are called palomitas, or doves, little doves. 

**Interviewer:** [00:55:02.5] You talked before about belaying, what's that?

**MILENA:** [00:55:19.5] Oh it's when you secure yourself with the cramps that open and shut. That's for free climbing. You don't have anything secured to the wall all the time, it's bit by bit, but that's a whole other thing. 

 [00:55:56.1] It's more invasive. The first time that someone tried to do Cerro Torre, the guy didn't even leave any hint of being there. So he came back 10 years later and he used a gas compressor and secured and made around 300 holes in the wall, to put the pitons, every metre. 

**Interviewer:** [00:57:36.0] How far are we to the end of the forest? 

**MILENA:** [00:57:37.8] You can see the clarity here. 

 [00:59:31.5] When did you arrive? 

**Interviewer:** [00:59:34.9] Three days ago to El Chaltén. Before through Buenos Aires. 

**MILENA:** [01:01:30.2] [Commenting on water, nutrition, and wind.]

 [01:02:18.9] On a yoga class I said I couldn't continue and the teacher answered that the pain is the master. You have to control the desires, the pleasure. You have to release when in pleasure. And also release when in pain. Because it's going to go in a moment. 

 [01:02:48.2] So this is a balance. You have to keep your mind quiet. Even if you are feeling pain, even if you are feeling pleasure. The Buda's teachings. 

**Interviewer:** [01:03:07.9] Applies well to mountaineering. 

**MILENA:** [01:03:32.5] To get to the next stream we have to get out of the forest. It's in the moraine. 

**Interviewer:** [01:03:57.1] So how far is it from here? 

**MILENA:** [01:03:58.0] From here could be 30 minutes. Do you want to drink water? 

**Interviewer:** [01:04:08.5] Yeah. 

**MILENA:** [01:04:10.6] Because I don't remember if we have like ... Sometimes they get dry. The streams. I remember that there's another one that is a little bit ... But I don't know exactly if it's dry or not already. 

 [01:05:04.5] I wish but I really don't know if we have a little stream, very very close from here. Not very far. But if it's not possible and it's dry, we have another option a little bit more ahead. Maybe less than 30 minutes. Maybe 20. 

**Interviewer:** [01:05:24.7] And how far are we from our initial destination, where we were going headed to? 

**MILENA:** [01:05:32.3] One hour. 

 [01:07:02.4] [About her child and the use of tight pants, happy to go out for a run.]

 [01:08:27.1] [And her child escaping from school and being called back in.]

 [01:10:15.6] [Benji comments on a boy that is running all day along the hotel's road and how champions are born.]

 [01:10:42.0] [Milena comments about her ex, and how too much sport on his side rested time and added distance to the relationship.]

**MILENA:** [01:12:02.1] I go often to Córdoba. Because my dad lives there. 

 [01:14:40.6] We are at 1,000 metres above sea level. 

**Interviewer:** [01:14:46.6] That's it! 

**MILENA:** [01:14:50.3] We've already hiked 600 metres from El Chaltén. 

 [01:15:02.3] Because Chaltén is 400 metres above sea level. And here it's 1,000. 

**Interviewer:** [01:15:15.5] That surprises me. 

**MILENA:** [01:15:20.6] It's progressive but it works! 

**Interviewer:** [01:15:41.4] The end point is ...?

**MILENA:** [01:15:43.5] 1,200. And the highest is 1,400. But we are not going to go there. 

 [01:17:42.1] Some anemones. We are close to get out of the forest. This is Viedma Lake. That way. 

 [01:21:12.8] Look. This is a flower from Calafate. 

**Interviewer:** [01:23:11.2] Almost there? 

**MILENA:** [01:23:18.4] Yes! 

 [01:25:20.2] This is llao llao. This is a fungus. A mushroom. Or Indian's bread. But it's not good for eating now. 

 [01:25:42.0] You can eat them when they are like this. Not very tasty. You can always find them in the ground. And so the reaction is because the tree tries to keep them away from the sun, and this reaction is like a ... [X].

 [01:26:18.8] If you do it with onions, and soy sauce it's going to be good. It's like chimmichurri. 

 [01:26:45.9] But when they are not with these holes, not good. Also we have other mushrooms here that are called morilla [morels]. Very edible. Very good. Very expensive. 

 [01:28:26.5] There was a river stream there but it's not ... No. So we have to reach the moraine. And then the lakes. 

 [01:28:49.6] Look at the flowers here. 

 [01:29:24.7] We can see Saint-Exupéry and part of the Poincenot on the left. And Guilhaume also. 

 [01:29:41.6] These are the mother and daughter lakes. And a little bit to the right is Capri Lake. And you can see that there's a moraine there behind the lakes. This is the Piedras Blancas Glacier, and the Moraines in the front. Well, we see many things here. 

 [01:30:12.4] Want to go straight ahead to the water and then stop?

 [01:30:33.3] Lago Viedma. Has got some icebergs. 

 [01:32:20.3] Do you want to stop here? 

**Interviewer:** [01:32:23.7] Just get water.

**MILENA:** [01:32:32.1] It's not far. Maybe we can go together and then they want to wait here. There's a place where I have the fossils. It's nearby.
