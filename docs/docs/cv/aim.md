Describe 
what you are looking for in your next job

I would love to find an excellent UX team in a small or medium-sized company. I've mostly done ethnography. Now I aim to develop soft skills in a tech company at a speed that can satisfy all involved: users, stakeholders, team, and myself. It would be great to work remotely but also open to relocating.

It would be great to work remotely but am also willing to move over to the US or elsewhere if there were an attractive position.
