Dear Recruiter,

I am aiming for the Web3 Product Manager role.

% I am not a Senior at the role and I beli

% 1
For the past 3 years, I've been working in the tech industry with global teams remotely and async. 
% 2
I trained as a backend developer for a season: 
the team taught me Agile practices, working as an independent and autonomous nucleus
producing meaningful outcomes periodically.
% 3
As a technical writer, I worked closely with the talent and marketing teams:
interviewing regularly with developers as subject matter experts,
I valued their knowledge and the relationships they opened up to me,
so this triggered me to aim and foster further these kinds of conversations.

% 4
Later, I worked as a Project Manager close to the Development and QA teams:
an interesting, challenging, and satisfactory role, 
since the team builds and sees 
hand-offs to the end-users thru quick iterations.
% 5
I have grown from technical positions to more hands-on roles, with ever more contact 
with several stakeholders, such as CEOs, users, and clients; 
aiming to deliver solid and timely results, 
focusing on teamwork, 
and making the best use of time.

% 6
I believe that my background 
as a sociologist gives me an awareness of all sides' needs, 
and fits me well for interviews, research, and testing;
I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User Experience [UX], 
all of which I hope help to deliver great products, and enjoyment with final results for all parties.

% 
% In my last job, as a Project Manager, I reached significant milestones: 
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item 1st trainee, out of 4, to prototype: new features' implementation for a client CRM 
%  \item building a
%  product for the internal talent team: 
%  an ATS [Applicant Tracking System] 
%  from scratch 
%  \item relaunch the company User Experience thru: our webpage, CTAs, landing page and squeeze pages
%  \item 
%  design 
%  reboot of
%  our internal email platform:
%  a clean, functional, minimal User Interface [UI] 
% \end{itemize}
% 
% I hope the fit is mutual, 
% and that my profile matches your needs.
%I understand that a meeting may be mutually beneficial. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials.
