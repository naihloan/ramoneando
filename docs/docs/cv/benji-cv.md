Experienced Product Manager with 5+ years of building innovative SaaS
B2C, B2B, and B2B2C products, in creator platforms, and digital content
creation. Proven track record of leading teams in pre-seed incubation
and public launch. Skilled in data-driven decision-making, UX
optimization for early-stage startups. Passionate about creating social
impact through products that blend tech, media, and wellbeing.

I look to contribute in Web3. I believe in the power of
decentralization, DeFi, opensource & community (using GNU/Linux for over
15 years), and how people get empowered with this new business logic,
leaving Web2 --at least partially-- behind.
