Dear Alex Smiley,

I am aiming for the Product Owner role.

I'm very interested in being part of a Product team, and I believe my
mixed background may serve you well. I'm a Sociologist and am now
finishing my studies as a Systems Analyst. I should clarify my
background as a Sociologist: I gained a Masters' scholarship to study
urban art in Brazil. There I trained in observation, interviewing, and
building hypothesis and tested it with the public.

I believe that my background as a sociologist gives me an awareness of
all sides' needs, and fits me well for interviews, research, and
testing; I also enjoy prototyping, wireframing, and attending to User
Experience \[UX\], all of which I hope help to deliver great products,
and enjoyment with final results for all parties. My past experience has
showed me that I gain and enjoy good chemistry with developers,
teams, and clients; and I am looking forward to growing on this path.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials. Sincerely
yours,

Benjamin Juarez

PS. I am an American living in Argentina and am flexible in work hours
and salary. If you want to reach me through WhatsApp you can text me at
