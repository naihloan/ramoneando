Dear Caitlin,

I am aiming for a role in Product, preferably as a Product Manager.

I have done community work from a young age and want to go further: I've
volunteered as a cook, a content writer, a house builder, planting tree
seeds, and as a speaker on how to vermicompost with earthworms. I am
engaged with the CEA's principles (purpose, minimalism, integrity), and
have a background as a sociologist: I enjoy conducting interviews,
listening, and attending to User Experience \[UX\] and challenges such
as posed by the CEA and 80,000 hours' communities. In my last job, as a
Project Manager, I reached significant milestones:

-   1st trainee, out of 4, to prototype: new features' implementation
    for a client CRM

-   building a product for the internal talent team: an ATS \[Applicant
    Tracking System\] from scratch

-   relaunch the company User Experience thru: our webpage, CTAs,
    landing page and squeeze pages

-   design reboot of our internal email platform: a clean, functional,
    minimal User Interface \[UI\]

You are my \#1 choice, so I hope the fit is mutual, and that my profile
matches your needs. Thank you for taking the time to consider my
credentials. If you are keen to meet, I am available on Wednesday to
Friday morning, from 9 to 10 AM, New York Time at
[benjaminjuarezarlt\@gmail.com](benjaminjuarezarlt@gmail.com). I
understand that you'll be proceeding slowly with expressions of
interest, I just wanted to be available and hoped for an encounter soon.

Would you like to meet up sometime this week or next?

Sincerely yours,

Benjamin Juarez
