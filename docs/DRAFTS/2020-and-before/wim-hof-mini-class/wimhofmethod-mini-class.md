Class 1: The Power of Breathing
-------------------------------

**Warning: Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g.
sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practice it before or
during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or any other
environment/place where it might be dangerous to faint. The breathing
exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is
explained.**

**Available subtitles: EN, NL, DE, FR, ES and PT.**

Breathing Technique Step-by-Step:

-   Step 1: Get Comfortable
-   Step 2: Start to breathe. Fully in (nose/mouth) then let go (mouth), continuously, 30-40 times
-   Step 3: Last breath - breathe out, emptying the lungs. Hold for as long as you can (no force)
-   Step 4: After the hold, take a deep breath in and hold for 10-15 seconds
-   Step 5: Repeat the entire process for another 2 or 3 rounds

#### Breathing Technique Tips

-   Relax. A relaxed body on an empty stomach absorbs more oxygen
-   Feel. Don’t get too hung up on counting, feel how your body responds
-   Observe. Record your thoughts and retention times (but remember it’s not a competition)

**Warning: The cold is a strong force. We strongly advise you to
gradually build up your cold exposure. Always train without force and
listen to your body carefully. If not practiced responsibly, you risk
hypothermia or an 'after drop'. Individuals should also not practice
cold exposure when pregnant, after drinking alcohol, after meals or
during exercise. If you have (serious) health issues, please always
consult a doctor first before practicing.**

-   Step 3: Remain relaxed, control your breathing and do your best not to tense up
-   Step 4: Smile, enjoy and never force it
