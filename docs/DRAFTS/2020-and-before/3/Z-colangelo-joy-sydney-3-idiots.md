## HOW FORESTS THINK | toward an anthropology beyond the human

#### Eduardo Kohn 2013

> _Settling down to sleep under our hunting camp’s thatch lean-to in the foothills
of Sumaco Volcano, Juanicu warned me, “Sleep faceup! If a jaguar comes he’ll
see you can look back at him and he won’t bother you. If you sleep facedown
he’ll think you’re aicha [prey; lit., “meat” in Quichua] and he’ll attack.” If,
Juanicu was saying, a jaguar sees you as a being capable of looking back—a self
like himself, a you—he’ll leave you alone. But if he should come to see you as
prey—an it—you may well become dead meat._

> _Whenever our lives feel stuck, in a rut, going nowhere, or spinning in circles, we can bet we are addicted. We are addicted to thinking and not doing._ [...] _Without mobility, you're stuck in one place over and over again, addicted to going nowhere._ (p. 52) _Put simply, you can't have a bad life unless you have a lifestyle that supports it._ (p. 53)


##### Chakra Six -- TRUTH

###### Brain, Nervous System, Eyes, Ears

> _We should be warned that **our pursuit of rote exercise can serve to exaggerate the very stressors we are exercising to reduce.** We clock our workouts, set fitness goals that measure lifted weight, record increased strength, and give gold medals to split second time gains. In fact, **exercise can make you sick**. Studies have taken those with high blood pressure (BP) and had them work out on exercise bicycles. While BP was lowered in many, about one-third of all men showed an increase in BP and stress hormones. Findings indicated that these men are **thinking about their problems** during the workout, essentially __hard-wiring stress into the motor cortex__. A simple tweak of the exercise routine, placing those men on real bicycles where they are distracted by nature, lowered the blood pressure. It is a good idea to place awareness on what you are thinking about when you are exercising. If you are degrading yourself with inner comments like, "I'm so fat" or "I hate jogging" while you are running, any cardiovascular benefit is over-ridden by the psychological and eventually, physiological stress._ (page 179)

La positividad necesaria y agradable me hace acordar a la peli indú que vimos recientemente: 

## [3 Idiots (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187043/)

La buena onda y el coraje para hacer frente a momentos difíciles se explica bien y sin ingenuidad ni ignorar los males del mundo. Uno de los mejores estudiantes de ingeniería diseña un drone y falta apenas un mínimo para que esté listo. Pero no le dan extensión en la fecha para que esté listo a tiempo.

- _Why won't it fly? I'll make it fly!!
- Hey don't tell Joy. We'll give him a surprise. We'll make this fly out his window and record his reaction.

- If we do his project, who'll do ours? 
- Test, viva, quizzes included, there are 42 exams in each semester.

- Hey, you worry a lot dude. Take this hand and keep it on your heart and say, "Aal iz well, aal iz well". All is well. "Aal iz well". 
- Now he has brought something new our Baba Rancchoddas!

- Hey in our village there was a watchman. He used to yell in night saying "Aal iz well". And we used to sleep tight. One night there was a robbery in our village. Then we came to know that he was blind. And he yells "Aal iz well, aal iz well" and we used to sleep like fools. But that day we came to know about the real fact. See our heart right, is a big coward. Keep our heart fooled. If you have any big problem in life tell your heart: "No problem baby, everything is ok". "Aal iz well, aal iz well"
- Hmm so that will solve the problem ? Huh?
- No but still it gains the dareness to survive. Remember this mantra, this is gonna become more useful over here._

##### AEROBIC METABOLISM

How we process everything in continous state, p.21:

> In all physical exercise, the immediate source of energy is the splitting of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The amount of ATP available in skeletal muscle is very small and is capable of providing energy for only a few seconds. However, creatine phosphate (CP) is also stored in the muscles and is readily available for the resynthesis of ATP. The CP stores are also quite limited and, in fact, the amount of energy available from ATP and CP concentrations in the muscles would provide for only about 15 to 20 seconds of heavy exercise. Furthermore, resynthesis of ATP must be provided for by either the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen (glycolysis) or the aerobic burn­ ing of fat or glycogen. In the former, the production of lactic acid is an ultimate waste product that must also be removed or that, in great enough concentrations, will bring about termination of the exercise.
> In aerobic metabolism, a metabolic substrate (fat or carbohydrate) is "utilized" in the presence of oxygen and at the expense of a certain degree of oxygen consumption. The waste products of aerobic metabolism are water (H2 O) and carbon dioxide (C02 ), both of which are readily disposed of by the body.
> When the intensity of running is low enough (below the level that requires a maximum rate of oxygen consumption - V02 maximum) and after the first couple of minutes of exercise, the body is capable of adequately resynthesizing ATP aerobically and a buildup (or con­ tinued buildup) of lactic acid will not occur. This, for example, is the case in a comfortable eight-mile training run when the runner is at a submaximal "steady state" of work.
> At the start of exercise (no matter how easy) or when a steady pace is interrupted by a burst of speed or an uphill stretch, the aerobic mechanisms cannot react quickly enough to provide the energy required and the extra energy is provided anaerobically. 

Interesting discussion on genetics, 25-26:

> In the final analysis, it is becoming more apparent that we must look to the local muscle cells for the key to the limits of oxygen consumption. Certainly, it is quite accepted that genetic differences exist in the ability to utilize oxygen. V02 maximum can be improved with training (apparently about 20%) , and since it is quite acceptable that not everyone is born with the same V02 maximum, it is easy to see that training will only elevate each individual's V02 maximum, or potential V02 maximum, a relative amount.

### Introduction: Cultural Economies of Waste | Gay Hawkins and Stephen Muecke

> _Meet a character from Don DeLillo's Underworld, Jesse Detwiler, a some-what brash salesman for the idea of a cultural economy of waste.! He is a "waste hustler, looking for book deals and documentary films, and teaches students at UCLA that **garbage is prior to civilization**: "Civilization did not rise and flourish as men hammered out hunting scenes on bronze gates and whispered philosophy under the stars, with garbage as a noisome offshoot, swept away and forgotten. No, garbage rose first, inciting people to build a civilization in response, in self-defense."_

> _A fanciful inversion, but he was already upsetting the order of things when as a "garbage archaeologist" (or garbologist) he was busted in the sixties for raiding and analyzing]. Edgar Hoover's trash and writing it up in the radical un-derground press._

#### Opening paragraph

> _Without a food safety net, 80 per cent of the world’s population are immediately at risk of hunger when natural disaster, war or unemployment strikes (Sheeran, 2011). The age of cheap food, which never existed for some, is over. One out of seven people wakes up every morning without the certainty of a meal. Ironically, those who work in agriculture are the most affected (FAO, 2013)._
