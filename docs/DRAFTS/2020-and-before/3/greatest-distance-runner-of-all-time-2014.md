Greatest Distance Runner of All Time 
====================================

Who is the greatest distance runner of all time? 
------------------------------------------------

Haile Gebrselassie

**

The greatest African-born distance runner of all time. Haile
Gebrselassie is the epitome of a legendary endurance athlete. His
unbelievable 21 year career highlights include: world records in 13
different distance running events, ranging from a near sprint-paced
record of 4:52.86 in the 2000m he set in 1998, to a knee-buckling pace
of 2:03:59 at the 2008 Berlin Marathon. In a sport dominated by athletes
in their mid to late twenties, Haile’s marathon record still stands as
the 3rd fastest in human history, and it is by far the fastest time run
by anyone over 35 years old. The amazing breadth, depth, and longevity
of Haile’s career surely places him among the greatest champions in the
world of distance running.\

**





The most decorated competitive distance runner of all time. Paavo Nurmi
won an astronomical 453 career races. His undefeated streak in all races
over 800m for 121 consecutive races will never be touched. Like the
Floyd Mayweather of distance running, throughout his 14 year career
Paavo Nurmi never lost a cross country race or the 10,000 meters. He
began a mostly self-compelled, and rigorously strict, training program
at the age of 15, and further honed his running abilities when he served
in the Finnish military as a teenager. In an impossible display of
distance versatility, Nurmi is the only person to ever hold the world
record in the Mile, the 5000m, and the 10000m at the same time. An
eternal legend in the sport of running, Nurmi’s indelible mark will be
remembered by runners and fans until the end of time.\

**





The greatest Olympic distance runner of all time. Emil Zatopek was
nicknamed the “Czech Locomotive”. His performance at the 1952 Helsinki
Summer Olympics ranks as one of the most incredible individual Olympic
performances in history. Zátopek opened his ’52 games with an exciting
come from behind win in the last lap of the 5000m, setting an Olympic
record at the time. He followed that performance with another Olympic
record, and gold medal, this time in the 10,000 meter discipline. After
mopping the floors with the competition in the middle distances, Zátopek
decided, allegedly on a whim, to try his first ever marathon during
these Olympic Games. He won the race handedly, setting a third Olympic
record in the process.\

**





The first globally famous Arab athlete and the greatest distance runner
of the 1980’s. Saiid Aouita held concurrent world records in the 1500m,
2000m, 3000m, and 5000m distances. Blessed with a rare mix of high
top-end speed and long-run endurance, Aouita was incredibly versatile
and consistent. With a dominating 5 year run in the mid-80s, Aouita rose
to the highest prominence in the sport of track and field and if not for
nagging injuries during the twilight of his career, he might have
maintained his run of dominance well into the 90’s or beyond.\

**





Ran the fastest 5,000 meter and 10,000 meter races in human history.
With a trophy case that includes 25 major career wins, 5 world record
events, and 3 Olympic gold medals, Kenenisa Bekele is Ethiopia’s second
greatest distance runner. His records in the 5000 and 10,000 meter have
stood unbeaten for nearly a decade. The 5000 and 10,000 races require
drastically different skill-sets, and no man has ever shown the same
elite balance of speed and endurance that Bekele does. To rise to the
top of the heap in a country with so many super-elite distance runners
like Ethiopia is a testament to Bekele’s greatness and we hope this
study has helped spread the word of just how incredible he truly is.\

**





The greatest middle distance runner of all time. Hicham El Guerrouji is
the third representative of the distance running powerhouse nation of
Morocco to make our GOAT study. His nickname “King of the Mile” was
coined in 1999 after he ran what is still the fastest 1 mile of any
human in history. At a blistering pace of 3:43.13, Guerrouji beat Roger
Bannister’s famous 1954, sub 4 minute mile by over 15 seconds! With
strong performances at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympic games, and an
impressive World Championship record, Hicham El Guerrouji is easily one
of the greatest Moroccan athletes of all time.\

**





The greatest long distance Kenyan runner of all time. In the country
most often associated with super elite distance running athletes, Paul
Tergat is the most decorated among them. His world record time of
2:04:55 in the marathon survived from 2003-2007 and is still the 5th
fastest time in history. Tergat also boasts Silver medals in the 1996
and 2000 Summer Olympic Games. It was the unfortunate career overlap of
his friendly rival Haile Gebrselassie that kept him from climbing the
top of the podium at the games. He might have been a bit overshadowed by
the other legends of endurance at the time, but Tergat’s legacy will
always shine bright in the hall of fame of the sport.\

**





Ran the fastest marathon time in human history. His 2:03:23 mark at the
2013 Berlin Marathon was a stunning 20% faster than the mark set by
Johnny Hayes in 1908 when official measurements were first recorded. No
person has ever run the grueling 26.2 mile distance in under 2 hours;
but no one has come as close as Kipsang, and with a still thriving
career he’s probably the best bet on the planet today to be the first to
break that seemingly impossible barrier.\

**





Current holder of the Marathon record for a US citizen. Khalid
Khannouchi became naturalized in 2000 in Brooklyn, New York City.
Perhaps his most impressive accomplishment was the beating of his own 3
year old Marathon world record at the 2002 London Marathon, a feat only
3 others have ever matched. With a late career that was plagued by foot
injuries, we may never know the height of greatness that Khannouchi
would have been capable of, but he should be proud to know that his
accomplishments have already placed him among the greatest distance
runners of all time.\

**





Widely considered to be the greatest American-born distance runner of
all time. Steve Prefontaine is one of the most tragic examples of
un-realized potential in the history of sports. Killed at the age of 24
in a car accident, Prefontaine’s early career trajectory places him
squarely among the greatest athletes in the sport, and projecting his
maximum ceiling is one of the most tantalizingly, if not depressing,
conversations in the running world. He set American records in 7
different events in the 2 years following his graduation from the
University of Oregon, and his time of 12:51.40 still stands as the
fastest 3 miles ever run by an American. While his legend may have been
magnified by his untimely death, there is no doubt that the man they
lovingly called "Pre" had miraculous talent and mental fortitude and was
surely one of the GOATs of his sport.\

GOAT Verdict:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [![Gebrselassie Greatest Distance Runner of All Time](http://www.thegoatseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Haile_Gebrselassie_GOAT.jpg)](http://www.thegoatseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Haile_Gebrselassie_GOAT.jpg)
  Haile Gebrselassie once said: “The person in front of me, he is just a human being as well; he has two legs, I have two legs, that is all. That is mentally how you prepare.” It’s a lesson that every runner on earth should take to heart. He was never the most physically imposing, rarely the youngest, and yet, Haile used that most vital weapon of endurance; his mind, better than anyone else. With elite scoring across the board, and the most impressive World Record, and Long Distance pedigree of any runner to make our list, Haile Gebrselassie is the GOAT Series pick for the greatest distance runner of all time.
