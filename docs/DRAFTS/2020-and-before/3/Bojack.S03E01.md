## Interviewing can become repetitive

#### Bojack Horseman S03E01

- [BoJack] It's a dream come true.
- [woman] You've been trying to get
this movie made for 20 years.
Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,
talking about Secretariat?

- Sitting here? In this hotel room? [clears throat] It's a dream come true.

- What's it like to play Secretariat?
- Dream come true.

- Playing Secretariat, what was that like?
- Dream come true.

- [woman] How long you in New York for?
- Just a couple days of fun interviews, then it's off to Chicago for more fun interviews, and then, if I don't blow my brains out, I get to go back to L.A.

- Darling, you're doing marvelously, I am so proud of you. If I could make one slight adjustment? Maybe fewer jokes about how these interviews make you want to blow your brains out?
- Right. Sorry. I am so thrilled to be here, talking with, uh...
-Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.
- Are you Finnish?
- No, we are just getting started. Walked right into that one. What would an Oscar nomination mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?
- Any award recognition is just gravy. The real joy is to sit in this hotel room all day, answering the same questions over and over again. Great answers, you're divine.

- I'm in love with you. One small adjustment. I don't think sarcasm is going to read. 
- Just write a script for me, so I don't have to think for myself. 
- Honey, I would shove my hand up your ass and control your mouth like a Muppet if it would win you an Oscar. What do I know? I'm just the publicist you hired to help win you an Oscar.

- [woman] What's it like to play Seabiscuit?
- I don't know. You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.

[man] Your last attempt at a comeback
was <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

37
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,137
Pass.
[man 2] People still see you as the guy
from that sucky show from the '90s.
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.
- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it
so the network could sell ad time,
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.
It did that well. It was a good show.
- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!
Great job today.
It could not have gone better.
My only note would be
stop defending <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
Why? Millions of people loved it!
We need to use these next few months
to define your story.
When people see you
they need to think Oscar winner,
not dumb asshole from an old TV show
that nobody cares about.
Okay, I hear what you're saying,
but we can both agree <i>Horsin' Around</i>
was a good show, right?
BoJack, you know
I think the world of you.
I think you are so smart and attractive,
so I'm not going to mince words.
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was a piece of shit.

Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.
I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.
