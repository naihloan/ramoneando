When you write in Vim, it doesn’t pretend that you’re looking at a book. It’s text. The notion of ‘presentation’ is off the table. Layout can take a running jump.

Vim presents you with the text at a much simpler level. [...]

##### Every imperfection jumps out. It’s just you, your eye­balls, and your text.

To Vim {#to-vim .entry-title}
======

I see that Apple has updated its word-pro­cessor
[Pages](https://www.apple.com/mac/pages/) again. The new ver­sion has
some sweet fea­tures, but if you open a doc­u­ment cre­ated in the
pre­vi­ous ver­sion, you will be asked if you wish to upgrade the file
format. On click­ing ‘yes’, the pre­vi­ous ver­sion of Pages will nev­er
again be able to open the file.

That, in itself, is not a prob­lem. But, let’s say, you don’t upgrade
your ver­sion of Pages imme­di­ately. Let’s say you wait until the
ver­sion after that. Will *that* ver­sion open the files you have right
now? Possibly not.

When a file format is updated, you get new fea­tures. I under­stand that
and I applaud. But there are dis­ad­vant­ages. Once you’ve been writ­ing
for a few years, and you look back for your
[floppy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk), your
[ClarisWorks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claris) files, or even your
[Kindwords](http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=37773&type=Software)
files, you real­ise that file format change is the krypton­ite of
lon­get­iv­ity.

Check out [this art­icle by Charles
Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html)
on Microsoft Word, entitled ‘Why Microsoft Word Must Die’. Now, we all
hate Word, don’t we? Come on. You do.

I hate Word from a pos­i­tion of some expert­ise, because, back in
2003–2005, I used it to write my PhD thes­is. That was a single
doc­u­ment con­tain­ing mul­tiple con­tents tables (some for chapters,
sure, but oth­ers for psy­cho­lin­guist­ic examples),
cross-ref­er­ences, a bib­li­o­graphy, and a great deal besides. I
learned the hell out of that pro­gram. Thus did I learn to hate it. It
is buggy, poorly designed, and over-fea­tured.

Going back to the point made by Charles Stross, it is a real shame that
the pub­lish­ing industry relies on Word as its work­horse.

Stross men­tioned anoth­er pro­gram that he some­times uses. It is
called [vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). I also use
it.

Format Wars: A New Hope {#formatwars:anewhope}
-----------------------

Back in 1976, the year I was born, Bill Joy wrote a text edit­or for
UNIX. That edit­or was called *vi*. It was designed to work over a
com­puter ter­min­al (i.e. a text-based inter­act­ive inter­face). It
had two modes. In the first mode, whatever the user typed would be
entered as text in the cur­rent doc­u­ment. In the second mode, the
key­board became a way of nav­ig­at­ing around the doc­u­ment. You can
read more about the pro­gram over at
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi).

The pro­gram was updated by Bram Moolenaar for the Commodore Amiga, a
com­puter I used as a kid. Moolenaar called his pro­gram
[vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). This stood for
‘Vi improved’. The year was 1991.

What’s It Like Using Vim? {#whatsitlikeusingvim}
-------------------------

Where I grew up, we often bought fruit from the vil­lage shop. The
apples didn’t come from China or South America. They tasted good, but
were a bit small and occa­sion­ally bruised. Later, we bought fruit from
super­mar­kets. They were nev­er bruised and they all looked the same.
Didn’t taste as good, but by then I’d for­got­ten what non-super­mar­ket
apples tasted like. Nowadays I eat ponsy ‘organ­ic’ apples, and they
tend to come from Kent, where I live. They’re smal­ler, more bruised,
but the taste real.

Where am I going with this? Is Vim some kind of home-grown product? No,
it’s American.

Is it tasti­er than Microsoft Word or Apple Pages?

Well.

It’s like this. When you write in Vim, it doesn’t pre­tend that you’re
look­ing at a book. It’s text. The notion of ‘present­a­tion’ is off the
table. Layout can take a run­ning jump.

Vim presents you with the text at a much sim­pler level.

If you—by which I mean ‘me’—write a story in Word, or Pages, and print
that bad boy out, the product you hold in your hand is some­what
disin­genu­ous. It mas­quer­ades as a fin­ished product. The
imper­fec­tions and short­falls of your prose are very slightly obscured
by the lay­out and present­a­tion, both of which are telling you,
uncon­sciously, that the work is already like the work you see in books.

> To *Vim* (verb): To remove super­fi­cial present­a­tion in order to
> reveal sub­stance.
>
> Example: ‘We were lar­ging it at the *Time Piece* last week until the
> last tune, *Get Lucky*. Then the main lights came on, the music turned
> off, and the boun­cers moved in. The place was totally vimmed.’

Every imper­fec­tion jumps out. It’s just you, your eye­balls, and your
text.

Stop Being So Arty-Farty. What Is It Actually Like To Use? {#stopbeingsoarty-farty.whatisitactuallyliketouse}
----------------------------------------------------------

### Vim is Fast {#vimisfast}

When you’re typ­ing text into the [com­mand
line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), the
com­puter is not ren­der­ing graph­ic­al gub­bins. Letters appear
slightly faster. Not so much faster that you notice it in Vim, but fast
enough to notice that text ren­der­ing is slower in most oth­er places,
not­ably Word and Pages.

### Vim as a Learning Curve {#vimasalearningcurve}

Vim has key­board short­cuts for:

-   Deleting sen­tences
-   Moving the caret to the start/beginning of a sen­tence
-   Moving x words for­ward or back
-   Jumping to the top of the doc­u­ment, to the bot­tom, to the middle,
    and so on

These take [time to
learn](http://www.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html). I’m
still learn­ing them. But, even after a few minutes, it becomes much
faster to nav­ig­ate a doc­u­ment using the key­board than using the
mouse.

### Rock-solid

Vim is used by a lot of geeks (mostly for pro­gram­ming). I’ve nev­er
encountered a bug or had it crash.

    Hey Ian,

    This is self-pro­mo­tion­al, but my big script­ing pro­ject for vim
    has just reached a mostly mature state. It is a pan­nable, zoom­able
    ‘infin­ite plane’ for organ­iz­ing massive amounts prose called
    “textabyss”. Check it out at:

    <https://github.com/q335r49/textabyss>

    Thanks!

    Leon

    Hi Leon

    Thanks for the link. I checked out the video and I think the concept
    looks really inter­est­ing. Reminds me a bit of the Archie(?)
    frame­work sug­ges­ted by Jeff Raskin, one of the ori­gin­al Mac
    guys. I haven’t got time to explore your Vim pro­ject at the moment,
    but best of luck with it.

    Cheers

    Ian
