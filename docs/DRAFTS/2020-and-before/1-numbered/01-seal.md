> Now, I’m not sure if you have ever seen an ultra-marathon before, but the competitors are an interesting breed of humans. As Sara said, “It’s like they put ninety people from an insane asylum onto a Greyhound bus, drove them out to the desert, blew a whistle, and said run for two days.” She wasn’t far off. Most of the runners looked like a cross between scrawny science teachers and confused goat herders. As we cheered on the runners, they enjoyed our support by thanking us and giving us high-fives. Some even engaged in light conversation. Sara could not believe the group. She anticipated super-fit athletes, not folks who looked like mad scientists in running shorts. But then, over the horizon, she saw what she thought was a mirage coming toward us. It was like the music from Chariots of Fire started playing in Death Valley as he approached. The guy was a machine. He stared straight ahead like there was nothing in his path and ran. His muscles were like a locomotive train. As he passed us, Sara jumped up and down and yelled, “GO! GO! GO!” Although there wasn’t another human within a mile of us or him, he didn’t even react. No “thank you”… no smile… no anything. “Holy shit,” she exclaimed. “What the hell was that?” Several months later “that” moved into our house.

Harvey is another of the “interesting people” that I cold-called to be my friend.


# Living with a SEAL | Jesse Itzler

> I believe the best ideas are the ones you don’t spend too much time thinking through. My time with SEAL was no different and I got a lot more than I bargained for. Most of my successes in life have come from learning how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Like I said, I just want to get better.


City bus drivers abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the streets. So did regular drivers. Plows couldn’t remove the snow for days. I was sure my mission with SEAL would be compromised. But that was before I knew him.

SEAL moved into my home to train me in December 2010. That winter went on to be one of the snowiest on record.

The event was low budget, really low budget. The entire course was set around a one-mile loop in an unlit parking lot near the San Diego Zoo. It was unsupported, meaning you bring your own supplies.

whereas everyone else was talkative and friendly, this guy seemed pissed. I mean he looked very angry. He just sat there all by himself in a folding chair with his arms crossed waiting for the race to start. No stretching, no prep, no fancy shoes, and no teammates. No smiling. He just sat quietly with a don’t-fuck-with-me expression on his face. His supplies for twenty-four hours: one box of crackers and water.

Once the race started, in between our individual legs of running, we stretched and stayed hydrated to avoid injury, and applied plenty of Vaseline. As a friend of mine likes to say: “Brother, ultras are chafey.” But as the race continued and I cheered on my teammates, I couldn’t help but keep tabs on the guy who was running alone. Who was this guy? There was magnetism to his fury. Underneath his scowl I sensed something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Maybe it was a sense of honor or integrity. Or purpose. Yeah, that’s it. He ran with a sense of purpose that I couldn’t quite comprehend.

When the twenty-four-hour race was over, I was cooked. My thighs were so tight I could barely walk a yard. As my teammates and I slowly gathered our extra sneakers, lawn chairs, and personal belongings, I noticed him again, this massive, two-hundred-plus-pound block of carbon steel, being helped to the parking lot by a woman (whom I would later find out was his wife), looking like he just survived a plane crash. I concluded two things: 1. I had never seen anyone like this. 2. I had to meet him.

Ninety minutes later I’m on ninety-seven. Training is definitely under way. Workout totals: 6 miles and 100 pull-ups

> What was hard was no Novocain. My dentist’s name was Henry Schmitzer, and his office was about a forty-five-minute drive from our house. I guess he was the only dentist my mom could find who would drill a kid’s mouth without an anesthetic. Henry might have been Laurence Olivier’s inspiration for the character he played in Marathon Man.

> The part of me that would grow up to hire a Navy SEAL, that came from Mom.

> “SEAL, my nuts are bleeding.” “Who gives a fuck about your tiny nuts?” he says. We keep pace. About a mile later I realize I don’t recognize anything. The buildings… the trees… nothing on the way back to the hotel looks familiar. This is not the way we came. “Sorry, man, but nothing looks familiar. I assume it’s impossible that you could get lost?” I manage to ask in between gasps. “Not with your training?” He glares at me. “Ranger school, bro… No chance.”

> At 8.3 miles, we finally find the hotel. I’m pissed off about the extra mileage. SEAL is satisfied. It’s like he thinks he got extra credit or something. The second we get inside, SEAL pulls out his training log and jots down a recap of the workout. Date. Time. Pace. Mileage, etc.

> SEAL has two gears: idle and full out. But his idle isn’t like normal idle at all; it’s more like the moment between ignition and blastoff. I get the feeling around him that things could get hairy quickly. And yet I also have a feeling of absolute safety around him. I don’t mean my own personal safety, though there’s that too. I mean like national defense safety. For three more hours I pace, eat, shop, and read. SEAL just stares.

> I’m not 100 percent sure why SEAL agreed to come “work” with me. As eager as I was to shake up my life, I bet in some way he was equally curious to see how I lived. To learn. To get some ideas about business, travel, family, and life after the military. I’m not really sure. It’s too early in our relationship, but

SEAL puts on the same outfit he has had on for the past five runs. I mean the exact same outfit. How did all his shit dry?

It’s a universally accepted fact that you lose a lot of warmth through your head. If you keep your head warm in the severe cold, you will have won half the battle of keeping your body warm. I usually always prefer to run in shorts (regardless of the temperature), but tonight I choose to put on a thin thermal legging because it’s so damn cold. During the ride down the thirty-seven flights on the elevator, SEAL doesn’t even look at me. It’s like he’s infuriated with me. Actually, he looks like he is mad at something way bigger than just me. Is he mad at the world? “Let’s get the fuck out of here,” he says as the elevator opens. “Fuck it. Let’s do six,” SEAL says as we leave. I don’t even question it ’cause he looks so mad. We run six miles in Central Park. Usually I run the loop of Central Park in a clockwise direction, but tonight he wants to run it in the opposite direction. He tells me we hit way more hills going this way. Not sure I really get that. To me it sounds like a word problem I had in eighth-grade math, but there’s no time to discuss. Off we go. SEAL does not look at his watch once during the run, and when we finish he hits the stop button on his GPS. I hear it beep indicating the run is done and logged. “We did those in nines,” he says. He then looks down at his watch… exactly fifty-four minutes. It’s like he is a human GPS. “SEAL, how the fuck did you know we were running nines without checking your watch?” “Instincts. You need to feel the pace.” This guy is like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of running!

I lightly knock on his door three times and then peek my head in. He’s sitting upright in his bed like he knew I was going to come in. “Hey, man,” I say. “You cool?” “You know what, Jesse?” SEAL says. “No, I’m not cool. I’m sick of this shit.” SEAL pounds his fist on the bed. “You’re too pretty, man. Too cute. Fuck you.” What? “Go grab a chair. The most uncomfortable chair you can find.” I have no idea what he’s talking about, but I go and get a wooden chair, one with no armrests, out of my home office and return to his room. “This?” “This is perfect!” SEAL says. “Sit down.” I sit in the chair. “Now go grab a fucking blanket,” he says. “Wait. What?” He doesn’t really think I’m going to sleep in A CHAIR? “You got to get out of your comfort zone, Jesse,” he says. “Enough of this comfy shit. Fuck this Park Avenue bullshit.”

> Sara also knows I’m going to make every attempt to complete any and all of SEAL’s challenges. But she didn’t think I’d be told to sleep in a chair.

> Now, I’m not sure if you have ever seen an ultra-marathon before, but the competitors are an interesting breed of humans. As Sara said, “It’s like they put ninety people from an insane asylum onto a Greyhound bus, drove them out to the desert, blew a whistle, and said run for two days.” She wasn’t far off.

No “thank you”… no smile… no anything. “Holy shit,” she exclaimed. “What the hell was that?” Several months later “that” moved into our house.

> I don’t think about yesterday. I think about today and getting better. —SEAL

I’ve been in and out of sleep all night but officially wake up in the chair at 5:30 a.m. I’ve never been more happy to be up at 5:30 a.m. in my life. My neck is KILLING me. I have an L-shaped back and my knees are locked. I think I got two hours of sleep… MAX. SEAL meets me in the den at 0545.

Now that we are three days into his stay and have “built a foundation,” SEAL decides he wants to test where I’m at… physically. We “agreed” last night to an 0600 start time for our “fit test.” Agreed means he told me when we’re waking up. Before SEAL got here, I had no idea how to convert military time into regular human time (the time the rest of the world operates on). But now I’m completely fluent in the conversion. So, at 0545 we head down to the gym for our test. Before we get started, SEAL takes his shirt off. He looks at himself in the gym mirror. It’s almost like he is doing it in slow motion. Checking to see if he added more definition to his Hulk-like body overnight. I apologize and explain that he has to keep his clothing on in the building gym, that those are the rules… that other residents will be coming down soon. He acts like I’m taking a toy away from him and telling him to brush his teeth, like it’s my rule. Like I’m the stuffy one.

we walk over to the pull-up bar for what he has coined “nickels and dimes.” We do five pull-ups (nickels) and then ten push-ups (dimes) “every minute on the minute.” We start every time the second hand is on the 12. If we finish in forty seconds, we then have twenty seconds of rest. We do this for ten minutes (fifty pull-ups and a hundred push-ups). However, by the time we get to four minutes, I have to drop my pull-up count to three. I can’t keep up. I’m a runner, but this is a totally different skill set. I assume most forty-three-year-old men aren’t doing eight pull-ups, let alone fifty. SEAL doesn’t say anything. He just pulls out his tiny journal and scribbles in it. I’m already incredibly sore and struggling. Pull-ups are not my thing. Plus I’m still sore from the pull-ups three days ago. SEAL says, “Okay, now we get started.”

We head over to the treadmill. SEAL hands me two twenty-pound dumbbells and sets the controls. Incline: 8. Speed: 4.0. He pushes the start button. I do this for eight minutes. It’s like a brisk walk up a moderate-size hill carrying a couple of suitcases. Then, every minute thereafter, SEAL increases the incline by 1. By incline 10 it feels like I’m walking up a steep hill carrying two camp trucks; by 15, I’m climbing the side of a mountain holding two minivans! When I’m done, my shoulder blades feel like they’re on fire. My thighs are jacked up. My lungs are so expanded it feels like they’re going to burst my rib cage. SEAL pulls out his tiny journal and marks it as such. In fact, I tell him to jot it down in bold: MISERABLE. We head over to the box jump. It’s twenty-four inches high. He times me on how long it takes me to do fifty: 1 minute, 57 seconds. SEAL pulls out his tiny journal and marks it as such. Then we go outside and run six miles.

> What’s amazing is that SEAL not only does almost every single workout with me, but he also does his own personal workouts on top of this. It was like the workouts we’re doing that are knocking me out are not nearly enough for him. My workouts are like his jumping jacks for a warm-up. We have only been together for a few days and I never really see SEAL lifting weights, but the guy is always doing push-ups. It’s like push-ups are his hobby or more like it’s his job. Or better yet, it’s his hobby and his job. Anytime I go into the kitchen I see him doing push-ups in his room or in the hallway. He’ll be in position, pushing up and down. And completely out of nowhere the guy will just drop and give himself twenty—at work, in the lobby, in the restroom. Anywhere and everywhere.

> “You good?” the doorman asks. Rather than answer and continue a normal conversation, SEAL drops to the floor and starts doing rapid-fire push-ups. “Hey, man, just leave that shit by the wall. Appreciate it,” he says as he goes up and down…

> It doesn’t have to be fun. It has to be effective. —SEAL

> “Sara, don’t EVER underestimate the power of adrenaline,” he says.

> We jump on the elevator and head down to the gym. There are already three other people working out when we get there. While the gym is fully operational and is loaded with equipment, it’s rare that more than a handful of residents are ever there working out at the same time. There’s a guy with blond hair doing what looks like a serious core workout. SEAL looks at the guy and then back at me. “What the fuck is Billy Idol doing here?” SEAL asks. “That’s Sting,” I whisper. “He lives in the building.”\
> It’s time to leave. We make our way out of the gym. “Well, that didn’t look fun,” Sting says.

> I throw the vest over my shoulders and strap it on. My immediate reaction is This is heavy. Like really heavy. It’s like having a big suitcase on your back. We do fifteen sets of ten push-ups, with thirty seconds of rest between sets. Total: 150. It takes me twenty-two minutes. It takes SEAL fifteen minutes. “This is no punk,” SEAL says. And it’s not. It’s so hard that even SEAL can’t go straight to ten without dropping to his knees after the sixth set. Yet all he keeps saying is: “This is great.” This is not great. This is brutally hard.

It’s so hard that even SEAL can’t go straight to ten without dropping to his knees after the sixth set. Yet all he keeps saying is: “This is great.” This is not great. This is brutally hard. I found out SEAL once entered a race where you could either run for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. Shocker: SEAL signed up for the forty-eight-hour one. At around the twenty-three-hour mark, he’d run approximately 130 miles, but he’d also torn his quad. He asked the race officials if they could just clock him out at twenty-four hours. When he was told they couldn’t do that, he said, “ROGER THAT,” asked for a roll of tape, and wrapped his quad. He walked (limped) on a torn quad for the last twenty-four hours to finish the race and complete the entire forty-eight hours. “When you think you’re done, you’re only at forty percent of what your body is capable of doing. That’s just the limit that we put on ourselves.”

I don’t need new friends. I like to keep my shit lean and tight.  —SEAL

We have two cleaning ladies who come to the apartment twice a week. They don’t speak a lick of English, and I don’t speak a lick of Spanish. So I have to use props and diagrams to communicate.



These women were immediately obsessed with him. I mean, SEAL is a nice-looking man. Have I mentioned that? And he walks around without a shirt a lot. A lot! In fact, I’m starting to notice that Sara’s friends are coming over lately for no reason. I guess they want to just look at SEAL. Since he’s moved in, the cleaning gals seem to be spending an extra hour or two cleaning. They also seem to be spending a lot time in his room despite the fact the guy is spotless. His room doesn’t need cleaning—ever! Military corners, you could bounce a quarter off the bed after he makes it, all his gear is stowed. I mean, the bedroom looks like it’s right out of a boot camp. But the ladies are always in there when SEAL’s around, talking to each other in Spanish and giggling.

Yesterday he ordered something that was FedExed to the apartment and one of the cleaning ladies accepted the package, he freaked out—not to them, but to me. “It’s a breach of security,” he said. Breach of security? “The integrity of the delivery was compromised.” He went on to lecture me about my naiveté when it comes to insubordination of the people who work for me. The only thing he ever said about anyone was they should be fired. SEAL didn’t think anyone who worked for the Itzlers cared enough or did their job like they should. He was really mad or suspicious of everyone he came into contact with except for Sara, Lazer, and me. According to SEAL, if my driver, Smith, was a minute late, it was because he didn’t study the routes correctly. If there was traffic, Smith should have anticipated the accident. In looking back on it now, I’m not sure SEAL was wrong. He was taught that if you have a job to do, you do it with 120 percent effort.

0600. I hear my bedroom door slowly open. There’s no nice way to put this, but it’s a bit unnerving because my wife is in bed next to me and I can sense someone else in the room with us. I feel a tap.



I feel hot breath whispering into my ear in a monotone voice. I guess the loud-intentional-noises-in-the-hallway trick wasn’t working for him. “Get up, motherfucker,” SEAL says. I get up. Fast. Sara remains motionless and oblivious next to me. SEAL tells me we’ll run another six miles in Central Park this a.m. That this is our last “primer.”

> He runs like a submarine. Silent. Deadly. The thought reminds me of a fart joke I heard in the fifth grade. We do the first three miles at a ten-minute pace. Then the next two at an eight-minute pace. And the final mile is seven minutes. When we get home my son is still asleep. So is my wife. She doesn’t even know there was a finger tapping me in bed earlier. The past two days when we came home from our morning runs I have been drenched in sweat. Soaked. My routine has been simple: I shower, grab a bowl of fruit and some bananas, then go to work. I eat only fruit until noon. That’s been my thing since I read Fit for Life by Harvey Diamond in 1992. For over twenty-five years, just fruit till noon. Harvey is another of the “interesting people” that I cold-called to be my friend.



Every time we talk, he ends the call with “Fruit till noon, brother.” One of the main underlying philosophies in his book is that we use more energy for digestion than all other bodily functions combined. That’s why we are usually tired after a big meal.

because on top of being sweet and delicious, it’s super-easy to digest. In fact, it is the only food that bypasses the stomach and is digested in the small intestines. It unleashes all its nutrients and goodness without using much, if any, energy, which frees up your energy for other things. As long as you eat fruit on an empty stomach, you can reap amazing benefits. According to Diamond, you don’t have to look beyond the animal kingdom to see evidence of this. The strongest animals in the world thrive on a fruit-and plant-based diet.



After reading the book in 1992, I decided to try the concept out for myself. I religiously stuck to a fruit-only diet until noon every day for ten days.



After reading the book in 1992, I decided to try the concept out for myself. I religiously stuck to a fruit-only diet until noon every day for ten days. After noon I generally kept it pretty clean—no fried foods, no dairy, no meats, but I didn’t waver from the fruit only in the a.m. I had an enormous amount of energy during that span and very “efficient” digestion. I felt so good that the ten-day trial period turned into twenty-plus years of following this routine. It doesn’t matter if I’m running a full marathon in the morning; I still stick to this program. Fruit till noon!



“Go New York Go” became the Knicks’ anthem and the number-one most requested song on New York radio during the 1993–1994 NBA playoffs.



As my wife likes to say, “Failure is just life’s way of nudging you and letting you know you’re off course.” Yes, I was on MTV and got to tour the country, but the hockey-stick-curve sales trajectory wasn’t there. So, I decided to “call an audible” and look for other opportunities in music. Writing theme songs for sports teams seemed like a great niche. I loved music. Loved sports. And nobody else was doing it. The result was “Go New York Go.” I started a niche… sports music.



The upside is this is the first time he’s actually asking questions about me. Not that I want him to, but it makes it easier to get to know someone when there’s a back-and-forth. As my wife likes to remind me, “When I talk to you… please play tennis with me and hit the ball back. It’s called ‘communication,’ and it’s important to a marriage.” And although I’m not looking to get married to SEAL, my wife has a valid point.

Our workout is basically the same routine as the morning, a loop around Central Park, except tonight comes with a bonus: Every half mile we do twenty-five push-ups. The other difference is that SEAL wants the pace to escalate, meaning every mile has to be slightly faster than the previous mile.

Every time we drop to do the push-ups, blood rushes to my head and I get slightly faint. I’m breathing so hard when we do the push-ups (plus it’s friggin’ brick cold outside) that I’m slightly hyperventilating. SEAL is knocking out the push-ups like a programmed robot.

SEAL pushes me so hard on the quarter miles I can feel my pulse pounding in my neck. I can literally take my pulse by just counting the thumps exploding through my neck.

Who is this motherfucker, and where did he come from? I don’t know much about SEAL’s childhood, but I do know that he always wanted to be in the Special Forces. The other day while we were sitting around he mentioned that he used to play Rambo as a kid. Not the way I would play Rambo (with a Toys “R” Us Rambo doll), but like real Rambo. When SEAL was fifteen or sixteen, he would go out into the deep woods alone around 11:00 p.m.

I’m starting to realize I know very little about SEAL. Actually, I don’t really know anything about him. It’s sorta like inviting your taxi driver home to live with you and your family and having him drive you everywhere, but you know nothing about the taxi driver. So now I’m wondering: What if I say something he doesn’t like politically? What if I say something that pisses him off? What if I accidentally offend him and he gets even angrier than he already is?

At the time, there were only three ways to fly private: One was to buy your own plane, which was impossible unless you were Mark Cuban or the Sultan of Brunei; two, buy a fraction of a jet, which comes with a very expensive five-year commitment; or, three, charter a plane, a process that has a lot of moving parts and inconsistencies. None of those options was very appealing to us, nor would they be appealing to any potential clients if we tried to start a company, which we had begun to think about.

We wanted to create something more realistic for a much larger demographic—people who wanted to fly privately a few times a year. So we came up with this idea: What if you could buy twenty-five hours a year of private flight time? It would be almost like a Starbucks card, or a prepaid gift card, to fly.

I’d gotten a call from a friend who wanted a favor. I don’t really remember why, maybe he was doing a business deal or maybe he just wanted to do something nice for someone, but he asked me if I could get tickets to a Christina Aguilera concert in Connecticut for a friend’s daughter. My friend knew that I had a relationship with Christina’s manager. So I called up the manager and not only did I get the guy and his daughter great seats, but I worked out having his daughter onstage as a backup singer if she wanted to (they would shut her mic off). I mean, for a teenager, this was a life-altering moment. The next day the guy who went to the concert with his daughter called me up

I was at a trade show and I saw Jay across the way from our booth. I decided to go over and introduce myself. Jay was my Ringo Starr: not the front guy of the band, but the guy that held it together.

Smith isn’t a tough-looking guy, but you can tell he’s tough. He’s someone you’d let win an argument because you’re afraid he’d fight you. But his exterior belies his interior.

I’ve never been one for stretching out. And I can honestly say I’ve never formally stretched in all my years of running. Not pre-run. Not post-run. It’s not that I’m against it; it’s just not my thing. But today I’m going to need to figure something out. I’m in this stiff-like locked mode and my body can’t function normally. I reach for the beeping alarm clock, and my arm can’t move from a ninety-degree angle. It’s stuck in an imaginary sling. To get up, I have to clasp my hands under my legs and hurl them both out of bed. I basically have to generate enough momentum to swing my legs over the side of the bed and onto the floor. They are that stiff.

It makes your cardio system work like you’re sleeping on top of Mount Everest. I’d have to bet I’m the only guy on the Upper West Side of NYC with an inflatable raft, an oxygen deprivation tank, a tent, and a SEAL in his apartment.

I start filling up my plate… nibbling away during the process. One scoop of veggies on the plate… one scoop directly into my mouth. I’m eager to sit down and eat, but food for me is fuel. I inhale… I don’t eat. I think sitting through a long dinner is an inefficient use of time. I like to stand when I eat. Why not… take in the calories fast… and be on our way? With that mentality baked in my DNA, I start ingesting the food on my plate as I walk into the dining room. First a fingerful. Then a handful. Then a full-on attack. I’m starving from all the working out. I get to the dining room table. “Sweetie, where’s your food?” Sara asks. I look down at my empty plate. “Did you eat all your food already????” I shake my head no. I can’t say no, because my mouth is filled with veggie burger. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m done. To me, we had a great date, no? So I sit and watch my wife eat. There’s not a lot of no-limits discussion at the table. In fact, it’s pretty quiet. The thought that I might have put a slight damper on our date creeps into my consciousness. After Sara finishes eating, she wipes her mouth with the toilet-paper napkins.

I did six-mile runs in the morning and three-mile runs at night. And two hundred push-ups in the middle like an Oreo cookie. It was actually a bit lonely doing the workouts on my own. Not that I miss the guy, but maybe a little? Today is no different. I did a six-mile run this morning. At 11:00 a.m. my cell phone rings and it’s SEAL. He tells me he’s on his way back to NYC and that he just completed the seventy-five-mile race. “How was it?” “Hard,” he says. “Really? Seventy-five miles was hard?” “It had a climb,” he says. “The terrain was tough.” I know SEAL well enough by now to know that if he says a race was “hard,” had a “climb,” and the terrain was “tough”… then it was TOUGH! “And… I broke all the metatarsals in both feet.” Huh? Check that. Tough times twenty. “But I finished strong,” he says. He finished?!

11:00 p.m. The front door of the apartment swings open. It’s SEAL. He has a key, but since he’s been living with us, we hardly ever lock the door during the day. What’s the purpose? Today is no different, and he opens the door. As he makes his way in, SEAL is walking like he’s stepping on broken glass. He’s limping and in obvious pain. He’s not wearing any shoes, and his toes are really messed up. SEAL is missing the toenail on his right big toe, and he has a few blisters that look like his toes swallowed giant red grapes. OUCH. “Man… that looks bad. You gotta do something for it,” I say. “Nah, I’m just gonna sit on the couch and enjoy the pain,” he says. “I earned it. Now I’m going to enjoy it.” He starts to laugh to himself.

I realize that there is no overplaying this kind of thing. There is no effect. He really means it. He really wants to enjoy the pain. Next day I’m at my office getting caught up on work when I get a call from Mark Rampolla, the CEO of Zico. He gets right into it. “A lot of people in the Zico office are reading your blog about SEAL,” he says. “Awesome,” I say. “Thanks for sharing.” “Yeah, they can’t believe you are doing this. You’re nuts. You must be getting in great shape, and you must be exhausted.” “Yes… and definitely YES!” “Well, anyway, we want to know if SEAL would endorse Zico. You know, use it at races and talk about the product, et cetera?” he asks as his words hang in the air like a puff of white smoke. I feel like telling Rampolla that SEAL doesn’t really talk, but I say “great idea” and I will ask.

It plays once and then I hear it again. Then again. And again. Then the song repeats approximately thirty times. What the fuck is he doing in there? I choose not to knock on the door but can tell there’s something serious going on in that room.

Finally, after the thirty-first time of the song repeating, SEAL walks out. He is soaking wet and leaving puddles of sweat all over the floor. “You okay?” I ask. “Twenty-five hundred push-ups, motherfucker. Yes, I am okay.” Sara walks into the room as she too is curious. However, I can tell her curiosity suddenly changes to concern. Something is bothering her. Really bothering her. I can see it on her face she’s trying to tell me what’s on her mind… without talking. She’s sending me some kind of husband-wife telepathy through her eyebrows and expression, but I’m not getting the message clearly. I wonder if I get points for at least knowing she’s trying to send me subliminal Morse code? Then her eyes slowly shift from my eyes to the floor. They go there in slow motion, taking my eyes with them. It is there that I see a puddle of sweat growing larger by the second on our silk Oriental rug.

As SEAL sits on our couch, sweat pours off his nose and lands on the rug in a steady flow. I immediately go to the bathroom and get two towels, one for SEAL and one to place on the rug. I’m in trouble. Sara calls me into our bedroom. “Don’t ever let that happen again,” Sara says to me. “I’m dead serious.” She says it in a tone that is way scarier than anything SEAL has said or done to me to date. It even rivals my mother’s silent treatment. “Never,” she repeats.

I’m wiped out. But I’m so wired from endorphins I can’t fall asleep. Never in my life have I worked out late at night. I’m used to knocking it out first thing in the morning. SEAL comes in and tells me to set my alarm for 0730. We are starting at 0800 sharp tomorrow, so I set my alarm for 0745. I want those extra fifteen minutes of sleep. It dawns on me that SEAL doesn’t have an alarm clock. Yet he never oversleeps; he’s always up when I get up. In fact, now that I think about it, I’ve never actually seen him asleep. I’ve never seen him yawn, never even seen him stretch or even seen him close his eyes for any length of time. This dude is a robot.

That’s eight hundred jumping jacks and two hundred push-ups in fifteen minutes! There was not a living thing stirring in Central Park while we trained. Not a civilian. Not a police officer. Not even a squirrel. I’m bruised and battered. The only way I could feel worse is if SEAL made me carry him home. I don’t give him any ideas. I just want to be warm.

First of all, I didn’t have enough money to rent an apartment so I was sleeping on friends’ couches. Second, the first deal I made didn’t exactly go according to plan. The artist we lined up was a woman named “Crystal,” who was confirmed to be a centerfold in an upcoming magazine issue. Mike Ross had suggested her to me. Maybe I should have known better since he turned her down. When I first talked to Crystal on the phone, I asked her to sing “Happy Birthday” to me as a kind of audition. The sound that came out of the phone was like someone with bronchitis trying to sing “Old McDonald Had a Farm”… while being strangled. But that centerfold thing… So… I agreed to do it! Again, get that foot in the door… figure it out later! Crystal already had some good marketing ideas in place. She’d worked out a deal with the magazine to publicize a contest where if you bought the record, you were given the chance to win a date with her.

I thought Spit was going to choke on the Eli’s baguette he was chomping on.

we arrive back in NYC and head home. SEAL greets the FedEx guy at the door. It appears Christmas has come early for him, or maybe for me. He ordered me my very own fifty-pound metal-plated weight vest for push-ups and to “increase the level of difficulty” of my runs. You’ve got to love SEAL. I didn’t even know my runs needed a higher degree of difficulty. “It’s on, motherfuckers!” he yells, jumping up and down as he opens the package. “It’s on!” I don’t think I’ve seen SEAL this excited—ever. He takes the vest from the box and puts it on. It fits perfectly. The thing looks like a suicide bomber’s vest. If he walked into a bank wearing it, people would dive under their desks and give him the combination to the vault without him even asking for it. “Today we test it out.” SEAL grins. We have one vest and have to share it, so I go first.

I pull over every hundred yards and drop to my knees and adjust the vest. I try to shift the weight to save my shoulders. The heft kills me. I shift again. It doesn’t help.

They also want to know what the fuck two grown men in weight vests are doing pushing a baby stroller in twenty degrees. I wish I knew… I wish I knew… At this point I’m out of options; the shifting provides no temporary relief anymore. I’m done. “What the hell are we doing? This is ridiculous.

I’m starving. I feel like I need at least ten thousand calories. Maybe that is because I burned ten thousand calories today. “SEAL, I’m ordering in some food. What’dya want?’ “I’m good.” “Come on, you gotta be starving.” “Nah, man, I’m good. I’m staying light.”

SEAL starts setting up the gym like a wedding planner would set up a reception. He lays out the bench press bench in one section, then grabs the curling bar and moves it to another section. After a quick assessment, he spreads out a rubber mat for sit-ups in another location. Before you know it, we have a variety of circuits perfectly laid out.

Costas is now ignoring the television and is focused on us. I fly through the workouts with zero talking. The workouts are starting to have a definite precision to them; meaning… SEAL is really focused on my form, and I’m finally getting comfortable with my technique. I think Costas has noticed the improvement. At least he has in my head. I grab my towel and we leave the gym. SEAL pats me on the back and says, “Nice work.” My first real compliment! 0650 I have to be at work at 7:00 a.m. for a breakfast meeting (well, the guy I’m meeting will have breakfast, I will be having fruit), and SEAL makes me wear the weight vest to the office today.

today we stand out. I think we look like suicide bombers from a J.J. Abrams movie. Shoulder to shoulder, black guy, white guy, down Park Avenue looking like we’re going to blow some shit up just for the sake of blowing some shit up. We are walking with some purpose down the street. “We’ll do this from now on,” SEAL says. I’m a bit freaked out. Not because of the weight of the vest, but because I’m thinking we are going to get stopped by the police. September 11 is still on people’s minds, and we don’t look at all sane. I’m worried that we will get asked to freeze and instructed to put our hands up and someone I know will see me. We keep walking.

Today he asks me what I do with my money. Meaning, do I invest it? In real estate? Stocks? He had saved some money from being in the military and is curious as to what to do with it. I thought that was very “human” of him! Rather than go into detail about my portfolio, I give him a quote that my wife says about money. “Money is fun to make, fun to spend, and fun to give away. That sums it all up.” He loves it! He looks at me like Sara had written the Gettysburg Address and I was reciting it. “Fuck yeah, Sara,” he says. So, I give him more.

If you were a charitable person before you had money… then money makes you even more charitable. But if you were an asshole before you had money… well then, money makes you an even bigger asshole.” “That’s some fucking real poetic shit right there,” SEAL says.

That was his whole existence. He didn’t have a car, a house, or anything to tie him down. If I fly someplace for a weekend, I always have to check my bag. He showed up at my house with a backpack.

Halfway through the run I start to feel like my Morning-Stars may come up. I’m cramping a bit but figure I can run through it. As the cramp moves from the side of my stomach to the center, I think it may be gas. I push. It is gas. I push a bit harder and a loud “fahhhhh” blasts out of my ass. It’s like a thundercloud has burst out of me. SEAL looks and me and says, “Fahhhhh,” in the same exact pitch as my fart. I keep running but start laughing hysterically on the treadmill. SEAL is standing there just staring at my pace on the electronic dashboard of the machine. No smile. No laugh.

Yoni is in amazing shape. When he moved to New York from Florida eighteen months ago, he weighed 240 pounds. I don’t know if it was the New York women or what, but something clicked in his brain and he decided to get in shape. He is now about 170 pounds and ripped. He has run several marathons and is a workout junkie. “Come on, Yoni, join us,” SEAL says. “We’re doing push-ups.” “I wish. I already ran this morning and swam just now, but thanks.” SEAL whispers something in my nephew’s ear.

It escalates even further. “Fuck this. Let’s start this shit right now.” These two knuckleheads decide to head out for a run.

They are so confused. I immediately introduce SEAL and explain that he is living with me for a month and tailing my every move. “Wait… like a Navy SEAL seal?” the Brooks Brother guy asks. “What kind of training?” the Prada suit dude asks. “Like lives in your house?” the sweater vest pipes in before I can answer any of the questions. All these guys want to do is talk about our workouts and why I hired SEAL. These guys are looking at me like I just invented the Internet. They’re blown away. It’s like when a stock on the New York Stock Exchange is halted and no business can be conducted. They’re obsessed with our dynamic. They keep asking questions. Two hours pass and it’s a question-and-answer frenzy. At the end of the meeting they say to me “If you have any ideas for us, let us know, we want to do something with you.” It’s like SEAL is a secret weapon. He’s the best closer. I’m slowly realizing how appealing SEAL is to others. Men in suits are fascinated by a guy like SEAL. His work ethic. His workouts. His history. So… indirectly they are becoming more interested in me.

I’m worried a bit about how SEAL will interact in the social setting. I mean, there is a good chance he will sit there and not say a word. He can be like a sphinx. When he comes to work with me every day, he never talks to anyone. EVER. Never logs on to a computer. Never reads a paper. He just sits there until it’s time to go. It’s like having a piece of artwork in my office. I know he’s trained to go off the grid, but it was wild. Not only to me but to everyone I work with. SEAL once told me that when he came back from a mission, when everyone would sit around and smoke and decompress, he would go running. After a twenty-four-hour mission, he would work out. As it turns out, I don’t have to worry about SEAL interacting with anyone tonight because he’s on a food mission. I realize SEAL’s eating habits are more complicated than I originally thought. For two weeks he hardly ate at all, except for his military-grade shakes. But at dinner this evening, he eats like a wood chipper. Steak, fish, fruits, vegetables, you name it—it goes down the hatch. Everything except dessert.

Best I’ve felt in eighteen days! SEAL is totally cool with it. He is letting me do my thing and enjoying his hall pass as well. The euphoria doesn’t last. When we get home, I definitely need to sleep. I was up at 6:00 a.m., worked out, had an eleven-hour workday followed by the party and all that alcohol. I’m toast. I can’t wait to go to bed. My body and brain are both in agreement. The day should be over, but my gut tells me it isn’t. It’s sort of like when you’re in third grade and look out at the one inch of snow that fell overnight. You hope school will be canceled, but you know better. So regardless of what my brain and body are rooting for, I make my way to my bedroom to get my shorts and sneakers.

My time with SEAL has convinced me the days of the fancy gym memberships are numbered. Things like CrossFit and street workouts are going to prevail in the future. All you really need to do is get your push-up and sit-up routine consistent, and you can see amazing results. I have another philosophy. You can be fit without being healthy, but you can’t be healthy without being fit. Meaning… you can be in great shape on the outside, but if you don’t eat great and don’t take care of your insides, you aren’t necessarily healthy. History shows us there were plenty of athletes who were in great shape but suddenly died of a heart attack. Balance is key. I also believe being in really good shape takes a combination of many components. For starters, you have to be strong, but you also have to be explosive, flexible, capable of running stop-and-go sprints and running long distances.

I’ve spent countless hours with SEAL running by now, and we haven’t spoken a word pounding the pavement for days. Complete radio silence when we run. Nothing ever said. “Hey, SEAL, what do you think about when you run?” “Finishing.” And he does. It’s like he is able to block out all the clutter in his head and the world, for that matter, and just focus on the task at hand. Say what you want, but the dude has mastered the art of being present. There is something really cool about that. As for me, I have a million things running through my brain…

After a light meal of plain pasta with nothing on it, sliced carrots, cucumbers, and a glass of water, it’s time for the second half of our reverse run. I would prefer to wait about an hour for my food to digest, but SEAL doesn’t want to lose an hour of his life. So, we go. As we ride the elevator down to the lobby of my building, I explain that I feel bloated. I like to run on an empty stomach and have a very hard time running with anything in me.

So I ask SEAL how he approaches nutrition during his long races. “I need calories when I’m running that long. I have trained myself to be able to eat while I’m running. I can take in six hundred to a thousand calories an hour, no problem. But it takes getting used to.” I hear the same thing from other ultra-marathon runners.

At around four miles I somehow figure out that if I breathe exclusively through my diaphragm, it feels a little better. I incorporate an unorthodox breathing style for the last two miles and make it home. It takes about an hour for my stomach to settle down, but the run is in the books.

“It’s time,” he says. SEAL tells me the plan is to run four miles every four hours for forty-eight hours! Twelve runs of four miles each every four hours! He calls it the 4/4/48. Are you kidding me? Apparently, he’s not. In fact, we’re going to train for it by running 4.25 miles four times in twenty-four hours, or four runs every six hours.

Twenty meters.” Now, how could he possibly know that? I can’t see one meter in front of me. In fact, I’m not sure I even know what a meter is.

SEAL is waiting at the front door. When we open the door, a bunch of snow falls into my foyer. It’s twelve degrees outside. We head out. It’s still as dark outside as when we got in from the last run, and it’s still as cold and wet. It’s like groundhog night. My muscles are super stiff from the cold (and the mileage), and my feet hurt when they hit the hard, snowy pavement. We do the same run as before in thirty-eight minutes. Brutal.

It’s run number three in our twenty-four hours of runs every four hours. The hardest part so far has been the process of exerting myself, cooling down, and then having to start again. The restart is a bitch. SEAL throws me a bone and says if we do the loop in less than thirty-eight minutes, we don’t have to run again in four hours. That’s a bone I like!

I was hoping he might pick up some buzzwords and think that I actually was supposed to be there. “Okay, fine,” he said, and he finished it and then I ran out.

The next day it was on national radio. “That’s some funny shit,” Seal says without cracking a smile.

We do twenty sets of twenty push-ups with a one-minute break in between each set. Let me repeat… twenty sets of twenty push-ups!!! The first ten are actually fairly easy. But the second half starts to get the better of me. I push my way through it and get to the final set. I’m jacked-up sore. “Finish up. GET THIS SHIT DONE, FUCKER.” I do. I have to hold a plank position in between reps for about twenty seconds on each of the last twenty push-ups, but I get it done.

Or maybe it feels like I wish someone would saw off my legs. “DEEPER,” he yells. I inch my way deeper, up to my waist. Then, all of a sudden, his expression changes. It’s no longer taut with anger. Now it’s furrowed and worried. “We got five minutes till frostbite.

Grab your sneakers and use them as gloves, climb out of the hole in the ice, and crawl across the ice with your BARE FEET sticking up,” he yells.

SEAL says “Today is goal day. Today all your hard work pays off. We are going to see if you can do one thousand push-ups.” I start the day off with ten quick sets of ten push-ups. We take a thirty-second rest in between sets. Feeling good. I rest.

My body is inflated from all the push-ups. I feel like I’m wearing a wetsuit and someone has pumped air into it. I’m jacked up. But to SEAL, victories are short-lived. He tells me he never celebrates an accomplishment. Once his goal is done, it’s time for his next goal. Our work is not done. It’s time for our next goal.

With fitness there’s never a finish line. You can always do better. For me personally, I guess I probably have thirty or forty years left on earth. And how many of those am I going to be young enough and healthy enough to do things? I want to experience the best stuff I can.

A thousand push-ups is something I could never have imagined doing. It just shows that repetition and consistency equal results.

I run it in 1:17:41 (an 8:57 average), with negative splits, which means clocking a better time the second half of the run than the first. I’m two minutes faster on the way back and I’m feeling psyched.

When SEAL is sure my wife isn’t watching, he sneaks down to the lake, grabs a boulder, and starts banging on the ice. And when I say boulder, I mean boulder, like from The Flintstones. This thing is huge, and SEAL has to bend down and lift with his legs and hold it with both hands before he can hoist it up. I look over at the kids skating and the game comes to an ice-spraying hockey stop. They are all watching SEAL. SEAL pounds away: Boom-crackle crackle… Again… Boom-crackle crackle… Again… Boom-crackle crackle… The hockey players head to solid ground. The ice breaks. I think somewhere in SEAL’s inner ear there’s a tiny orchestra playing the theme song from Rocky. It’s like he’s at the top of the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and he raises his arms in a victory pose. He gives a primal scream of “YESSSS!” Socks off, shirt off… he’s in!!!! I start to hear the Rocky theme too.

He didn’t need any instructions: He was spotless, thoughtful, and polite. But when SEAL really won her over is when Sara’s grandmother, Nannie, stopped by one day in Atlanta. Nannie’s right out of The Andy Griffith Show. SEAL was a total gentleman and did everything for her: carried her bags, made her breakfast, and walked with her on his arm. She adored him. When Nannie was around, I think she was SEAL’s primary! Nannie kept referring to SEAL as “that nice young man.” She would say, “Jesse, that nice young man… that friend of yours is just darling.” Sara seems to be very intently folding a blouse. “I’ve been thinking,” she says after a moment or two. “We should try and get SEAL to stay a bit longer.” As I’m looking at my wife packing it makes me realize what a difference a month can make. I know SEAL infinitely better than I did when he first showed up, but I still don’t know him know him. But I think that’s by design.

SEAL must not have taken his patience pill when he took his handful of vitamins today because as soon as we start the run, he takes off. Every few straightaways he becomes visible for the first few miles, but then he completely disappears. He beats me there by eighteen minutes.

“What’s for dinner tonight?” Seal asks. “A big red chicken?” He cackles like it’s the funniest thing anyone has ever said. We head out to Central Park for the 6.1-mile loop. It will be our last run. My first run with SEAL in New York was thirty days ago. We ran the exact same loop. We did it in 56:04 (a 9:20-mile pace). After one month with SEAL training me, I’m running a 7:50 pace per mile. As usual, we don’t talk on the run, even though it was to be our last. There was no final test, no congratulatory conversation, nothing. Like two running partners who run every day. There wasn’t anything unusual about the evening either. We had dinner together in the apartment. SEAL played with Lazer. Sara chatted with him. Although she tried not to show it, I could tell she was genuinely sad our time with SEAL was coming to a close. So was I.

Pre-SEAL I sometimes would be on the couch and not want to do whatever needed to be done and I’d be like “Fuck it,” and blow it off. Procrastinate. I don’t think like that anymore. Just get off the couch and do it is what I remind myself. SEAL would never say, “Fuck it.” He’d get off the couch and do it. Regardless of the time, the temperature, or how tired he was. I absorbed some of that just-get-it-done and there-are-no-excuses attitude. I’m grateful for that. My perspective on time has changed too. I got so much more done when SEAL was here. I was much more efficient.

both in training and at work. SEAL has an I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude that really makes him different. He’s an African-American Navy SEAL, of which there aren’t many, an African-American who competes in endurance sports that are dominated by Caucasians. He doesn’t give a shit. SEAL does what SEAL wants to do. He doesn’t live the way everyone tells him he’s supposed to live. And he does it with purpose. I admire him for that. His normal has been abnormal. We have that in common. The first day SEAL came to move in, he told me I needed to control my mind. I thought it was just a saying or a throwaway comment, but I think there might be more truth to it than I originally thought. Our minds sometimes tell us little lies about ourselves, and we believe them. We think we can’t do this or that. It’s not true.

SEAL also left an indelible mark on me. I’ve never been stronger, faster, or mentally tougher (take me to a frozen lake and I’ll show you!). I can do a thousand push-ups in a day. I smoke the times I used to do around the Central Park Loop. I literally don’t have an ounce of fat on me. But getting me in supreme shape was only a part of what SEAL did for me. I have houses, a driver, fly privately. I have all of these things. SEAL has a military ID and cash. That’s what he walks around with, just a backpack of belongings. He didn’t want my life and I wanted his life. For starters, I’m going to simplify things.

maybe the most important thing I learned from SEAL was the level of appreciation he has for difficulty. The harder the training, the more courage it took to do and the more satisfaction was derived from it. SEAL taught me that you only get one shot at life and you should find out what’s in your reserve tank. Coasting is for “pussies” as SEAL would say and it’s when you dig deep that you feel the most alive. He lives his life that way. And some of that rubbed off on me.
