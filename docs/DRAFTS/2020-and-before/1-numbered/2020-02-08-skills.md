Cooking and running skills with Tim Ferriss

inspired by the 4 Hour Chef, how can someone learn to run far?

+ have faith in yourself, believe like Louis Pasteur in a Children book collection. trust that all, or at least something is possible. this way you can start. start. soul (no thoughts)
+ enjoy, explore  what you choose to do. so it doesnt feel like work.emotion
+ habits are easier if you get into the rhythm. persist
+ set a goal

 you dont need all of them, but likely that one at least. the more the better.
