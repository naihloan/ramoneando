Thor | Presentation | Introduction
==================================

I am Thor. But not in the good god sense. I am not a norse God, nor a semigod comic hero. Nor am I a Chris Hemsworth, with which a Tahani Al-Jamil fantasizes more about social status than erotically. Nor am I the actor representing a James Hunt that intensively lives a merciless 1970s rivalry in Formula 1. I do have the worse trait of Hunt's representation.

James Hunt, as shown in the movie *Rush* (2013v), is not interested in a lot of things, most simply he wants to run a fast ride, feel the thrill to live, and win a world championship. Here comes a key point. Some people want to reach a certain personal expectation in a certain way: for some, like Hunt, it may be to become a champion. But, he just wants to know how far up he can reach, even if it is a single time. Others, like his nemesis and later friend Niki Lauda, want to be at the top for ever. In a certain sense, James Hunt is a relaxed character that knows how to enjoy life after he wins his ultimate sport goal. And yet, why do some people just set the bar once and then lay back, while others have a drive to always be struggling, even when successful? Both try to aim to a horizon, yearn: only that one stays on track for more time. (Inspiration for yearning: George Costanza, aka Cartwright)

One can be very silly with goals. Trying to run a marathon can be the goal of a lifetime for some. For my self, running a marathon was a high point after running 10Ks for over a decade, while delving into 20Ks and 30Ks. Marathon was my high point from which I then descended into almost total coach potato (Later on I would remain more or less thin, and with a calm jog around the nearby park on a weekly basis for over 15 years, but without it coming naturally, or with ease and companionship as before when I took races with my dad, who left running golf). It is in this sense in which I say to myself, with very little or no pride, that I am Thor. I am the James Hunt that wanted to reach a peak. Suffice to say that by bar was very much lower: I simply wanted to jog a full 42.195K, and then I just didn't do much of anything else athletically after that 2004. I ran a marathon at age 24, and then I left all athletic challenges, and much more, aside. This is not a text about Marvel movies, nor about formula one. But it is an attempt to understand what humans (including myself), non humans, and more-than-humans are made of and what moves them (here: ultra running), and/or gives them wings, even if at their footwear, like *Hermes*; or simply what makes the spirit take off, cruise, or crash.

Do you have a friend that is doing so bad in life that you don't tell him anything shocking, nor critique him afraid about his fragility and that s/he may kill himself? I do. Actually the delicate point is not about the possible ulterior drastic measures, but the fact that we all carry some level of fragility: what to do with it? One point of view is to say *be gentle*. Another point of view states that we shouldn't put cotton on every edgy corner of the world to be cautious. *The world belongs to the bold* goes the saying. I worry about my fragile friend/s, and I also think that they should be more active. And me too. That is a little bit of two reasons why I pushed myself over the edge to go ultra. So: yearn on the one hand; and as another layer that superposes with the prior, a need for activation, overcoming.

Moral-Technical Note: I just wrote that I *should* be more active. The implication is not an ethical one, but simply a analysis of consequences. If the wish is to live feeling well, then more activity is deemed to be better than sedentary. I may believe this to be true for others as well under specific circumstances. But I don't want to be self-righteous, nor a moral proselytizer: not everyone needs to do sport nor go outdoors, nor even move if not in the scope of interests. Many people don't need (more of) that whatsoever. It's simply that I believe that in many cases a little of activity and outdoors would benefit people that lack them and that are not doing very well. Some people may lack and do just fine. I do *not* believe that running or going ultra in any sense is a general recipe to move forward, or strive: simply a handy hack for those interested in coming closer to another (outer) world. 

~~\* I am recalling, right now, the width of interests and active pursuit of a self taught young boy who at a Ted Talk quoted "how to find your way to a complete view of the world", in *Hackschooling makes me happy* [Logan LaPlante @ TEDxUniversityofNevada 2013v]. He finds inspiration in Roger Walsh's *Lifestyle & Mental Health*, who promotes, 8 Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes [TLCs]:~~

+ Exercise
+ Diet & Nutrition
+ Time in Nature
+ Contribution & Service
+ Relationships
+ Recreation
+ Relaxation and Stress Management
+ Religious & Spiritual

It is a bit by chance that very separate things end up getting mixed together: athletics, motivation, and adding a bit now of nutrition, and why not, also some considerations on meditation, focus on breathing, stretching and being outdoors. This sum up may seem a bit out of hand but are the components that I ended putting together to make in short time the most to boost conditioning. 

In my 20s I simply trained by moving outside and just putting hours under my feet. I really enjoyed the process but I knew several things were missing, but at that time it felt OK to do without. At nearly 40 years of age, I find that I need to stretch plenty since I am below average on that spot, and I also need to readapt my body to running. 

As of meditation and breathing, I enjoy them and have found that they help to combat physical stress, along with cold showers and stretching, a recipe by the Wim Hof Method, it is claimed that all activates the circulatory system, and the autonomic nervous system. It is not sure that there is already a scientific basis for this, but it seems to help me out with strength in mood and it is an enjoyable try out. So summing up some preliminary training methods, a brief athletic resume, and motivations I would add that apart from a desire to aim higher, and to lead an active life, there may be at least two other reasons I want to go ultra.

1.   After finishing marathon, there was a little voice inside still thinking and asking. *I think I still have more inside me. How much more may there be left, and how much further could I go?*
2.   I think I am pretty lazy nowadays: my jobs have been very intermittent, I don't seem to have much energy in mood and physic (mentally I always feel active, even if I have some patches of very bad chess performance) and I don't show myself to others as very useful (I am an unemployed Sociologist in a country that doesn't even know that the profession exists, or what it is capable of). So there begins the paradox: Can a person be lazy and run ultra at the same time? I believe so. Later on we shall examine the ramifications. 
3. As a bonus, one should suspect that the reasons to do things are not always explicit, even for oneself, or possible to be listed in numbers. 
    + *I felt like breaking something beautiful* they say in *Fight Club*, while beating with inspiration.
    + *Sometimes you just* do *things*, says ultra runner Scott Jurek in his first memoir.
    + A certain christian masochism can say that being selfless, and forgetting about the body and its pain is OK.
    + Opposite to the prior: what's so bad about having a six-pack (abs)?
    + In sync with the prior: is it not pleasant to go to the countryside and eat all that you can and want?
