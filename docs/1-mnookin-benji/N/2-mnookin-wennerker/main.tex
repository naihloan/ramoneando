 \item[Reporting.] May lead to micro-management
 \item[Going to useless meetings.] No unlimited meeting invites please.
 \item[Overworking.] Except one sprint at night or weekend once a quarter, or once a year.
 \item[Telling others to do things, pushing.] In a team effort, we are looking for space for collaboration, but I'm not the boss of my teammates.
  \item[Burocracy.] I dislike delaying results and delivery:
% You need to lay back a bit,
 It's OK to chill
 but %also
 make the product grow, deliver value, on time;
 for users, team, business.

\section*{Strengths \& Weaknesses}

\subsection*{Strengths}

\begin{description}
 \item[Belief] in: self, others, team, company. My view of the compant and team make me super high drive, and persistent.
\item[Curious.] I love learning, but my fuel is in placing questions forward and not staying stagnant with a simple eternal answer. Iteration and nuance are key.
\item[Supportive.] I push causes to happen, and I believe we can all give something out to the world. wagmi: we're all gonna make it.
\item[Ownership.] I believe to have both confidence and certainty to move forward, and I strive for other people to gain them as well.
\item[Strategist.] Always aiming for the big picture: am I going to be happy about this work in 20 to 50/200 years? I truly hope so.
 \end{description}

\subsection*{Weaknesses}

\begin{description}
 \item[Contrarian:] sometimes wrongly
 \item[Interruptor:] a fine art that should never be learned
 \item[Overly Imaginative:] going off rail to derivatives can be unproductive for working on immediate goals. Let's better plan one step at a time %so we can
 to stay in sync
 \item[Unexperienced Professional Background:]
no well-known, big-name company on my resume as an employer.
Primary experience in unstructured companies, mostly regional, in LatinAmerica, and in a promising Music Startup (with HQ in US and Europe) but that hasn't yet gained traction.
