\section*{Strengths \& Weaknesses}

\begin{description}
 \item[Belief] in: people's capabilities and that they can bring a lot to the table, from both a work and personal view.
 self, others, team, company.
 My view %of the company and team
 makes me %super
 high drive, and persistent.
\item[Curious.] I love learning, but my fuel is in placing questions forward and not staying stagnant with a simple eternal answer. Iteration and nuance are key.
\item[Supportive.] I push causes to happen, and I believe we can all give something out to the world. wagmi: we're all gonna make it.
\item[Ownership.] I believe to have both confidence and certainty to move forward, and I strive for other people to gain them as well.
\item[Strategist.] Always aiming for the big picture: am I going to be happy about this work in 20 to 50/200 years? I hope so. Let's plan steps and execute!

\subsection*{Weaknesses}

\begin{description}

%  $ $ $ $
 I believe in people's intent and their heart-felt beliefs and actions. At the same time,
 I can disagree with their ideas and perspectives,
 and it's a challenge to communicate both angles.
%  at the same time
 \item[Interruptor:] a fine art that ought
%  should
 never be learned :P
 \item[Overly Imaginative:] going off rail to derivatives can be unproductive for working on immediate goals. Let's better plan one step at a time %so we can
 to stay in sync
 \item[Data insufficient:] I'm biased to teamwork and intuition. It's OK to build quickly and iterate, but %it would  be
 it's best to plan strategies with hard-data. % based decisions.
 It's one of my next steps, but not there yet.
%  \item[Unexperienced Professional Background:] no well-known, big-name company on my resume as an employer. Primary experience in unstructured companies, mostly regional, in LatinAmerica, and in a promising Music Startup (with HQ in US and Europe) but that hasn't yet gained traction.
