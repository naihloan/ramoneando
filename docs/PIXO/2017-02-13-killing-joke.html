<blockquote><em>just one day can change everything</em></blockquote>
<p>what does in fact change things? under same circunstances one person or thing can change and other doesn't. it's the mystery of diferential affectations. the unchanged can be a virtue in this story, but at the same time it just isn't funny.</p>
<p>all that matters for the physical world would seem to be functionality, but a tilted picture on the wall just doesn't comply to the same idea than a straight one. in art, every detail can be transformative. that which does not produce effect and/or affect perhaps is outside the realm of art.</p>
