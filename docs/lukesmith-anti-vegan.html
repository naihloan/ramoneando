<h1>"Veganism is the Pinnacle of Bugmanism"</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>by <a href="../index.html">Luke Smith</a></p>
<p>
People have quoted me as saying that.
I forget where it comes from, probably a livestream, but I definitely stand by it.
Since a lot of people labor under the assumption that my channel is about "Linux," I've accumulated a lot of subscribers that are variously nerds, furries, degenerates, coomers, libertarians, communists, trannies and among them are vegans.
Some of them (I assume) are good people.
</p>

<p>
There's a stereotype about vegans that they are annoying and can't talk about anything but Veganism.
This hurtful stereotype comes from the fact that it's true.
</p>

<img style="margin:auto;display:block" src="pix/grill.gif" alt="Grill" title="I just wanna grill!">

<h2>Bugmanism</h2>

<p>Firstly, what is Bugmanism?
How do Vegans fit the bill?
</p>

<p>Long story short, a bugman is someone who rejects the purpose and role of humans in their natural environment.
They reject tradition, religion, their family, gender roles, the expectation that a person should contribute to their community, etc.
They might do this for their personal convenience (usually they just wanna coom outside of marriage)
or for apparently rational reasons, but the effect is the same.
</p>

<p>
If you want to sum up the esoterically evil goals of "modernism" or whatever you want to call it, it is destroying the countervailing power of tradition and in its place, new social engineers attempt to dictate human values top down.
If you separate people from their families, their races, their traditions and <em>who they actually are</em>, you can engineer TV shows, sports teams, activist movements and a million other things for them to identify with and worship.
<strong>Modernism pretends to liberate people from arbitrary traditions and authorities, when in reality is substitutes natural, emergent morals with controlled authorities.</strong>
</p>

<p>Veganism has always been one of the most radical examples of this logic.
Esoterically, <strong>Veganism forces one to abandon not just their own traditions, but every human dietary tradition</strong> and leaves them at the whims of processed grains and pharmaceutical supplements for a meager survival.
</p>

<p>That is, Veganism is highly disruptive:
You can't have a normal life.
You can't have a normal meal.
You can't wine and dine with people and must make it an affair.
You can't use traditional hand-made leather products.
You can't hunt or trap for food or raise animals, even for eggs.
</p>

<p>
You become a nag at war with your family, the world around you.
<strong>You are trapped</strong> <em>within</em> urbanite bugman society:
you can't even eat in most non-urban places or foreign countries because the insane concept of not cooking with animal fats and eating and using animal products just doesn't exist.
You have to survive holding your breath from one hipster downtown area to the next.
</p>

<p>On every point, you become more reliant on macro-society.
Vegans try very hard to give off "organic" vibes, but it's just a lie.
Even people on the internet who "advertise" their Vegan lifestyle spend hours processing a basic meal and of course predigesting indigestible plant matter with a blender.
Try and find a non-urbanite Vegan in real life.
They exist, but they are an aberration.
</p>

<h2>The LARP of "Vegan for Health"</h2>

<p>Vegans sometimes pretend to advertise Veganism because it's allegedly healthy.
This is just public relations; any true Vegan, when you really pin them down thinks that Veganism at its core is a moralistic belief.
Vegans are Vegans because they believe that not being Vegan is morally deficient: killing/eating animals and using their bodies is bad.
That's it.
</p>

<p>So you have your moral principle and run with it.
What magical force then is making that moral principle necessarily good for your health?
If Veganism <em>were</em> actually a good diet for humans, that would actually be a massive coincidence.

"Vegans for health" have to grapple with the bizarre claim that meat,
exactly the food that has been viewed in all human cultures as superior and more desirable
is somehow nutritionally deficient.
</p>

<h3>The Standard American Diet (SAD) is Plant-based.</h3>

<p>
The weirdest thing is when Veganism is held in opposition to the Standard American Diet, as if the American diet somehow represents traditional or non-Vegan diets.
<strong>The SAD is just Vegan-lite.</strong>
SAD is a post-Vegan invention of the diet industry take over the past decades has been leading people into the most harmful parts of vegan diets: unstable plant-oils, processed grains as meat substitutes, etc.
</p>

<p>The pop-cultural idea of "health" is simply "being skinny."
Veganism is <em>great</em> at making people skinny because it is slow moving starvation (I have met some carbo-loading exceptions who fatten up).
</p>

<p>
Veganism is just to starvation what waterboarding is to drowning.
If you stick with it, you <em>will</em> eventually die, but it's so painful in the meantime, you'll probably give up.
</p>

<h2>Veganism is rational.</h2>

<p>Vegans are exceptionally "rational" in that they adopt the moral framework of modern society and follow it to its logical conclusion.
</p>

<p>When you're given for your acceptance some
inane religious platitudes like "equality" and "rights" along with
vaguely Marxist notions of "exploitation" and "slavery" and "oppressed classes," it seems perfectly reasonable to expand that language to the relationship between predators (humans) and their prey (many animals) (or maybe pets too).
</p>

<p>
If you're raised in a time of extreme moral nihilism except for not liking the several historical events you're told that matter (usually slavery and the Holocaust), obviously you're going to glom on to what looks most like them: chickens in chains and sheep being led to slaughter like sheep to slaughter.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, Veganism by their own logic might not be far enough.
There is some circumstantial research to the effect that plants have nervous systems that might feel pain as well: you could go one step further and simply eat nothing living.
The <dfn>Ctistae</dfn> of ancient Thrace refused to eat anything alive, eating only by-products/foodstuffs like milk and honey.
The Ctistae also refused to have sex, which might be something to consider since Vegans eventually lose sexual function anyway.
</p>

<h2>Veganism is rebellious.</h2>

<p>
Veganism has the same kind of "rebellion" that all other forms of leftism share.
It "rebels" against the system by perfectly internalizing the system's values,
extrapolating them to their logical conclusions
and thus fighting the system when it fails to meet those obviously unworkable conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Corporations started shilling vegetable oils (which originally were and frankly still are just industrial by-products) as workable replacements for butter and lard.
Seventh-Day Adventists lobbied for them because of their own religion beliefs.
Jews lobbied for them because they hate unkosher lard.
Years later, now we know that vegetable oils are highly unstable and have contributed to the massive rise in heart disease.
</p>

<p>Veganism is a leftist phenomenon.
The psychological type of a leftist is such that they will always subordinate their direct experience to ideology.
It doesn't matter if not eating meat or wearing leather or using animal products sounds hard, their suffering is more proof of a greater moral superiority.
</p>

<p>
Non-leftists can simply not become Vegans for longer than extremely brief periods.
Even if a Vegan wins an argument with them, a normal person is just going to say, "I'm sorry, I like animals and all, but I can't not eat them, that's just crazy."
</p>

<h2>Veganism only makes sense in a bugman environment.</h2>

<p>Ask a vegan why he doesn't eat eggs.
He will probably tell you a spooky story about how terrible it must be for a chicken to live in a coop laying eggs all day.
That might even bring a tear to a sentimental persons eye.
</p>

<p>Out where I live, people have their chickens wandering in their yards and garden pecking scraps.
They return to their coops at night to be safe from coyotes.
Is there really something "unethical" in the mind of a Vegan about picking up an unfertilized egg lain by one of these chickens and eating it?
</p>

<p>A lot of the moral logic behind Veganism falls flat outside of bugman capitalism.
Fundamentally, it's another manifestation of general angst from lack of connection to the real natural world.
</p>

<p>I say this because most Vegans are Vegans because they are softies who have literally no connection to animals whatsoever until as a teenager they watched a PETA documentary with chickens getting their heads buzzed off or pigs walking around in their own poop.
</p>

<p>
Literally think about the animals.
When wild animals die in nature, they don't slowly slip away in the night surrounded by their family.
They die of starvation, or by being ripped apart alive by packs of coyotes.
Would you rather die by getting your brains blown out instantaneously or die a "natural" death <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg9_ZnojxmU">like this</a>?
</p>

<p>But to the original question, it really makes no sense even for a Vegan to not eat or distribute the eggs a chicken lays... You're going to have to get deep into Marxist analysis to think that's somehow unethical.
And once a chicken has living a long life of egg laying, why not quickly and painlessly <a href="https://poultrykeeper.com/general-chickens/how-to-kill-a-chicken/">dislocate its neck</a> and eat it for dinner?
If you don't, your cat will eventually gore it and it'll be a mess.
</p>

<h2>Animals live to be eaten.</h2>

<p>This isn't even a metaphysical claim.
Domesticated cows and pigs and chickens do not and cannot live as they exist in the wild.
They have evolved symbiotically with us as sources of food.
They can go feral and breed with wild boar and the like, but their composition is based on their domesticated state.
</p>

<p>Wild game like deer have lived alongside human hunters for centuries.
Their breeding habits and evolutionary development is based in the fact that a <a href="http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/outdoors/study-sheds-light-on-top-causes-of-deer-mortality-b99190938z1-241992741.html">sizeable portion</a> of their population will be hunted by humans every season.
</p>

<p>
If you actually care about "the environment" (1) you would care for humans, whose natural diet is meat and
(2) you would be terribly
worried about the unintended consequences of severing one of the most important links in the food chain.
</p>

<h2>Dumb Vegan sayings</h2>

<h3>"You wouldn't kill it yourself!"</h3>

<p>They say this whenever someone turns their eyes away from an animal being killed in one of their Vegan propaganda videos.</p>

<p>Guess what, I also might turn away if I see a video of a sanitation worker wading through human feces it in a sewer.
That doesn't mean that I'm a hypocrite for taking dumps in a toilet connected to city sewage.</p>
<p>I turn away when I see depictions of amputations of gangrenous limbs in movies too.
That doesn't mean I don't think it's not medically necessary.</p>

<p>Killing animals is actually a bad example of this because while all cultures are disgusted by feces and amputations, in most times and places (including this country before Bambi), killing animals was nothing any self-respecting grown man would react to.
It goes without saying that there are many countries where people still recreationally torture dogs and cats.
</p>

<p>I don't say that to say that I'd be okay with killing dogs and cats, merely that the trained moral responses we have for them are very localized and subjective in our own modernist viewpoint.
But Millenials have now been raised in a Disney fantasy-land where animals think and talk like us and therefore must share the same feelings.
Vegans absurdly "imagine what it'd be like" to live in industrial farming as if a chicken's birdbrain is having an existential crisis while living in a cage.
</p>

<h3>"Veganism is minimal or more self-sufficient."</h3>

<p>Vegans have been fruitlessly trying to meme this one on me for forever.
Starvation and death is minimal, I suppose, so it is at least true in that sense.
<strong>Veganism is ultimately the diet of only eating inedible garnish that looks "good" on Instagram.</strong>
</p>

<p>Raising most animals is easier and more efficient than raising vegetables.
If it's too hot, potatoes don't naturally know to go move to the shade.
Yams don't eat your overgrown grass.
Onions don't poop out fertilizer.
Tomatoes can't pull a simple tractor.
You can't skin dead okra and make leather out of it.
You can't grind up old mustard to make bonemeal (that's not just something in Minecraft, by the way).
</p>

<p>Animals are an absolutely necessary portion of any homestead in life and death.
Listen, I like growing stuff. I like growing vegetables.
But vegetables are just not real food...
They are garnish.
They are sides.
They are only enjoyable insofar as they elevate your enjoyment of real food: meat.
</p>

<h3>"Veganism is more efficient or environmental."</h3>

<p>People say that eating plants is more "efficient" because they saw an energy pyramid diagram as a kid, which shows how many prey animals are needed to maintain carnivorous animals.
If we actually lived in a place where there was a calorie shortage, like a desert planet where greens couldn't grow, that might be an issue.
It frankly just isn't here.
We're not exactly running out of grass to feed cows. Most people are mowing their grass and throwing it away.
</p>

<p>There are people who make really absurd environmentalist arguments against meat as well, for example, methane from cows warms the globe.
Okay. Fine.
So what does Veganism do about that?
Are Vegans going to kill the cows for us?
Should we just let them starve in the woods since we can't harvest them for meat or even milk?
What about all the game we won't be hunting?
Those 50% of deer annually that we won't be killing&mdash;won't they me causing pollution with the huge amount of calories they need to frolic in the woods all days?
Same will all other game.
Most of those arguments are cute just-so stories and they fall apart after examination.
Anyone can play that game.
</p>

<h2>Let's just laugh at this for a minute...</h2>

<p>Alright class, look at this commonly posted vegan meme and tell me why it's retarded:</p>

<img style="margin:auto;display:block;max-height:400px" src="pix/vegan_protein.jpeg" alt="Vegan protein" title="Vegan protein">

<p>"Per 100 calories" shows a deception so insane you should laugh.
Whoever made this image wants you to <em>believe</em> that the piece of steak on the fork is equivalent to the tiny broccoli head on the right.</p>

<p>You can compare the nutrition of both <a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-fresh-or-dried-vegetables-broccoli-raw/uhZAljTASPuU9YnkyCZdFA">broccoli</a> and <a href="https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-beef-ground-beef-80-lean-20-fat-pan-browned/MJPo9HnUSnGiV2-9eBsCBw">beef</a> at those links yourself.
</p>

<p><strong>In order to get the protein in a single large bite of steak, you'll have to eat more than half a pound of broccoli.</strong>
Good luck.
Now you know why those poor impressionable girls who go vegan bloat up.
And that's only 100 calories.
2000 calorie diet? Have fun.
If you're famished, it's pretty easy to eat a big steak with 2000 calories (around a pound and a half of matter) and it will fill you up without any bloating or stomach pains.
You'd have to eat <em>twelve pounds</em> more or less of broccoli or equivalent greens for that.
And with all that fiber, you're going to just be pooping it all out.
</p>

<p>Honestly, the human disgust response will stop you way before that.
It's easy to eat a juicy steak without or without sauce, salt and pepper, but you'd nearly have to put a gun to someone's head to make them eat their daily 13 pounds of indigestible garnish.
</p>

<h2>Noootruits don't actually matter anyway</h2>

<blockquote>"Plants don't have over fifteen micro-nooootrients..."</br>
    &mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGenreDoesntMatter">sv3rige</a>, at the end of every video
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of Vegan autism gets focused on replicating the consumption of known nutrients and minerals using only plants.
The image above, in addition to being deceptive is based on a flawed idea that human nutruition is about <em>consuming particular amounts of particular substances</em> as if we are a perfectly predictable machine or a videogame.
This <strong>isn't just a Vegan problem</strong>, basically everyone implicitly has this idea.
</p>

<p>The reality is that those nutrients on the Nutrition Facts are a narrow realm of what might actually be relevant for the complex organ of our bodies.
Additionally, there are many types of proteins and vitamins and minerals that the back-of-the-box doesn't account for.
The Vegan game of saying, "we can get that too" is utterly pointless when you realize we have nowhere close to a full idea of how the human body works, only some plausible theories about the relationships between certain nutrients and what they seem to do.
As in the case of some nutrients, like the falsely-maligned cholesterol is a good example of something two generations of people were told to fear and reduce only for us to later realize that our ideas about how it interacted in the body were arguably literally backwards.
