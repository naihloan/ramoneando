# 252 Tip from Angela - Location, Location, Location!

Now one of the common things that I hear students say is hey why is it that when I go through the tutorial everything seems so easy and so obvious.  But then what I try to do something myself like create a project myself or try to complete a code challenge and it seems like almost as if I actually didn't learn anything at all.

## Practice

Well the reason is because that the learning comes from the practice.

So don't view watching the videos as learning.  That's just me introducing you to a concept.

It's only when you apply it yourself then you actually learn.

So always tried to watch the video see what's happening what the gist is.  If you take down a few notes names of functions or things that you might need to use and then pause the video and try to complete it yourself that way you're actually putting the skills into practice and you're actually learning instead of just absorbing passively.

## Psychology of Learning

And one of the biggest learnings I've read from and one of the most interesting things from psychology studies is something called the Dunning Kruger effect which is where when you first start learning something you can feel like wow I know so much I know everything there is to know about this topic.

But then as you gain more knowledge you realize Oh no actually there's a lot more stuff out there that I don't know.  And then you fall into a pit which is called the valley of despair and this is also sometimes referred to as imposter syndrome where even then you feel like you've spent a lot of time learning this skill.  You feel a bit like an impostor because you think people are going to find out that I actually don't know anything.

And both of these are exaggerations.

You are somewhere in between both of those places.

## Keep Practicing

And if you just keep persevering keep practicing keep putting what you've learned into action then you're gonna get there in the end.

So keep going.
