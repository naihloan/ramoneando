Dear Cosmin,
great to hear from you. Many thanks for your mail. No worries on delay, fully understandable how the hectic academic timings work.
I'm preparing my PhD project and can send you a draft in the next week I believe. 
Now I just began reading your pieces since I was looking for some additional references. 
On your "'Soft pedal!' Slowing down societies by bike": What year is this paper from, how/can I quote it? 2016?

Comments on Bike topic:

- Don't you use always the same speed/cadence of leg swing? In running it is suggested that at any speed/stride that you go ... you should be doing 180 rpm (or 90 to check just one foot; or even 60, on a 1,2,3 waltz rythm). I understood it was the same for cyclists. Am I wrong? Some people even listen music to that beat: https://cycle.jog.fm/

Nota bene: I normally write in Spanish in my blog. However, once in a while I write something in English.

I liked so many points in your presentations that I made [a commented post](http://ramoneando.com/sociology/benja-2016-07-popan.html) of what relates to my focus:

- Slowing down traffic is something I haven't thought of and liked. I've always had in mind that runners are a parallel flow to car-traffic but didn't realize that in the relationship they can change the speed of others (inside cars).
- Physical exposition and potential of perception is something that I do have in mind and can relate to a literary text: Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It's a bit long but makes some good points on how we think about materials and how are thoughts are processed in a combination of analysis and synthesis.

Just sharing some thoughts, I'll send you my project soon. Thanks too for your interest.
Best,
Benji
