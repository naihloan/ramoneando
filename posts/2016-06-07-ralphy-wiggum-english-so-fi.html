<p>Poor Ralphy Wiggum is not stupid. He is just a kid, he's still in elementary school. Perhaps his academic coefficient is fairly low. But what draws attention towards him is that he's smiling most of the time, he receives his parent's love, and he is apparently naïve.</p>
<p>His letter of presentation is introducing a crayon, or whatever he finds nearby, into his nose and say <em>I am special</em>.</p>
<p>To argue that one is a unique snow flake in the universe you need to have very little (or much) imagination, or have an extremely high opinion of yourself, almost with no consciousness of the external world. How could we know if we are all special, or only some? Or nobody? But, in relation to what? We amount to so little in the grand count of the stars. An American band knows this and carries a flag on that idea: <em>Alien Ant Farm</em>.</p>
<p>In the end, mocking the ingenuity of little Ralphy is a fierce irony. What actually awakens empathy towards him is that we all have a bit of that: an empty, simple gaze, with no further explanation. What do we know about cosmos, of the meaning of existence and how to live a joyful life? At least this last point is something that he carries on very well, and that we would well do to emulate. </p><br>

<p>Q: What are some examples of sociological fiction?<br />
A: There are many books that arguably sit on the blurry border of sociology/fiction &#8211; WEB DuBois, Frank Parkin, Ann Oakley, Patricia Leavy, Gabriel Tarde, David Buckingham have all written novels. I haven&#8217;t come across any short sociological fiction, hence this zine</p>

<p>Q: Why?<br />
A: I think there are many reasons sociologists should work with fiction. I&#8217;ve written about <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1749975516639081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fiction as a method for public sociology</a> in Cultural Sociology; Theory Culture Society published a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276415595912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special e-issue on fiction and social theory</a> in 2015; The Sociological Review is currently running a <a href="https://www.thesociologicalreview.com/news_stories/tagged/sociological-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog series</a> on sociology and fiction; and The Sociological Imagination often posts on <a href="http://sociologicalimagination.org/archives/tag/sociological-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fiction and sociology</a> too.</p>
