Poor Ralphy Wiggum is not stupid. He is just a kid, he's still in elementary school. Perhaps his academic coefficient is fairly low. But what calls to attention on him is that he's smiling most of the time, he recieves his parents love, and he is apparently naive.</p>
<p>His cover letter is introducing a crayon, or whatever he finds nearby, into his nose and say 
<em>I am special</em>.</p>
<p>To argue that oneself is a unique snow flake in the universe you need to have very little (or much) imagination, or have a extremely high value of yourself, almost with no consciousness of the external world. How could we know if we are all special, or only some. Or nobody too. But, in relation to what? We amount to so little in the grand count of the stars. An american band knows this and carries a flag on that idea: <em>Alien Ant Farm</em>.</p>
<p>In the end, mocking the ingenuity of little Ralphy is a fierce irony. What actually awakes empathy towards him is that we all have a bit of that: an empty, simple gaze, with no further explanations. What do we know about cosmos, of the meaning of existence and how to live a joyful life? At least this last point is something that he carries on very well, and that we would well do in emulate. </p>
