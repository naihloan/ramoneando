--------------------------------------------------------------

“For Kierkegaard, for Heidegger, for Sartre, the more profound the
awareness, the more authentic the existence. They measure honesty and
the essence of experience by the degree of awareness. But is our
humanity really built on awareness? Doesn't awareness--that forced,
extreme awareness--arise among us, not from us, as something created by
effort, the mutual perfecting of ourselves in it, the confirming of
something that one philosopher forces onto another? Isn't man,
therefore, in his private reality, something childish and always beneath
his own awareness? And doesn't he feel awareness to be, at the same
time, something alien, imposed and unimportant? If this is how it is,
this furtive childhood, this concealed degradation are ready to explode

“Not surprisingly, because too much attention to one object leads to
distraction, this one object conceals everything else, and when we focus
on one point on the map we know that all other points are eluding us.”\

“I am a collection of the family's body parts.”\

“I placed no trust in faiths, doctrines, ideologies, institutions. Thus
I could stand only upon my own feet. But I was a Pole, molded by
Polishness, living in Poland. And so I needed to look deeper for my
‘self,’ in the place where it was no longer Polish but simply human”\

> “I became bold because I had absolutely nothing to lose: neither honors,
nor earnings, nor friends. I had to find myself anew and rely only on
myself, because I could rely on no one else. My form is my solitude.”\

“I even stopped walking to give some thought to the fact that everyone,
after all, wants to be himself, so I too want to be myself, for example
who would love syphilis, of course no one loves syphilis, but after all,
a syphilitic man also wants to be himself, namely a syphilitic, it is
easy to say "I want to be well again," and yet it sounds strange, as if
to say "I don't want to be who I am.”\

> “Isn't it true (I thought), that one is almost never present, or rather
never fully present, and that's because we have only a halfhearted,
chaotic and slipshod, disgraceful and vile relationship with out
surroundings.”\

> “A universal style is one that knows how to embrace lovingly those not quite developed. ”\

> “Don't change the beggar into a conqueror, because it was the beggar who led you to conquest.”\

> “To contradict, even in little matters, is the supreme necessity of art today. ”\

> “If you were to stare at this box of matches, you could extract entire
worlds out of it. If you search for tastes in a book, you will certainly
find them because it was said: seek and ye shall find. But a critic
should not rifle, search. Let him sit back with folded arms, waiting for
the book to find him. Talents should not be sought with a microscope, a
talent should let people know about itself by striking at all the
bells.”\
