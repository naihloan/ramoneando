<h4>Mayor Shear's View</h4>
<blockquote><em>
<p>&ndash; What are you doing? I didn't give orders for a halt.</br>
&ndash; We all need it.</p>

<p>&ndash; We're still five hours' fast march from the objective. Maybe six. Come on.</br>
&ndash; You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.</p>

<p>&ndash; Yeah. You're gonna leave me here.</br>
&ndash; If you stop, we stop.</p>

<p>&ndash; You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark. You've got to get there before sundown.</br>
&ndash; But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route ..... or whether we could find you if we did?</p>

<p>&ndash; If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.</br>
&ndash; He doesn't know it, but I do. You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.</p>

<p>&ndash; You'll go on without me. That's an order. You're in command now, Shears.</br>
&ndash; I won't obey that order. <mark>You make me sick with your heroics</mark>. You carry the stench of death like the plague. Explosives and L pills go well together. It's one thing or the other. Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself. <mark>This is just a game, this war</mark>. You and that Colonel Nicholson, you're crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules ..... when <mark>the only important thing is how to live like a human being!</mark> I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden ..... because <mark>I don't care about your bridge or about your rules</mark>. If we go on, we go on together.</p>
