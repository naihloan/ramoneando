## W. E. B. Du Bois

> _The return from your work must be the satisfaction which that work brings you and the world's need of that work. With this, life is heaven, or as near heaven as you can get._

> _Herein lies the tragedy of the age: not that men are poor, — all men know something of poverty; not that men are wicked, — who is good? not that men are ignorant, — what is Truth? Nay, but that men know so little of men._

> _Believe in life! Always human beings will progress to greater, broader, and fuller life._
