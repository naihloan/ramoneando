<blockquote>
<p>! There's a couple of episodes in the Supernatural series [Season 11, eps. 20-21...etc?] in which <strong>God appears</strong>, and does so as personified by an old-known character: The Lord appears as <em>Chuck</em>. Personal opinion: the conversations on these chapters try to tackle both the emotion of being in front of the Creator of all; and also the escepticism, reasoning and complaint of why he's not around. The answer: overparenting is not always the solution, in His words:</p>

<p><em>Being overinvolved is no longer parenting.</em></p>
<p>Up to here is just to explain the motives and angles in which each character functions.</p>
<h2 id="to-the-question">To the Question</h2>
<p>After talking about several matters He says that he wants to take a shower, and asks for the bathroom, where is it? &gt; - Where's the guest room? I could use a shower.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Uh, it's, um... just down the hallway --the fourth door on the left.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence the points for question, there must be some good explanation on why He wouldn't know that. Something along the lines of <em>Chuck, as he prefers to be called, has his humanity too...</em> But this isn't enough it would seem.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-god-not-know-something">How can God not know something?</h1>
<p>Isn't He supposed to be omniscient? (aside from his Sister, which is a whole other topic)</p>
<p>Edit. Later on He says he likes bacon. That's fine. But then porn... mild wtf? I mean, sex is nice. But doesn't xxx imply certain objectification (hence non holy/divine)?</p>
