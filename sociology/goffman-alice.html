<em>We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way: good and bad, innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being wrongfully convicted. 
<!-- So if you're convicted of something you did do, you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people, there are victims and there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that. --></em></p>
<p><!-- 11:43 Right now, --> 
	<em>
	we're asking kids 
	who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, 
	who have the least amount of family resources, 
	who are attending the country's worst schools, 
	who are facing the toughest time in the labor market, 
	who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem, 
	we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line -- to basically 
	<em>never do anything wrong</em>.</em>
	</p>
<p><!-- 12:07 --> <em>Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges? Why are we offering only handcuffs, jail time and this fugitive existence? Can we imagine something better? </em>
<!-- Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery, prevention, civic inclusion, rather than punishment?</strong> A criminal justice system that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions. And finally, a criminal justice system that believes in black young people, rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up.--> </p>
