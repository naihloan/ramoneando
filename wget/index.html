<p>Uncovering user behaviors, needs, and motivations in order to design products and services that provide value is the crux of user experience research. When performed correctly, these methods have a huge impact on business. As such, the role of the user experience (UX) researcher is becoming more prominent, more specialized, and more in-demand.</p>
<p>According to Payscale, <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=UX_Researcher/Salary">the average UX Researcher salary is $82,565 per year</a> with an estimated 10-year job growth of 19%. Within this role, you have the opportunity to make a significant impact—not only on the business, but also on the products and services that people interact with every day.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you become a UX researcher?</strong></p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll take a look at how to navigate a career in UX research. Although there is no singular path, there are four main steps that will move you forward in the right direction: <strong>expanding your knowledge of the user research field</strong>; <strong>obtaining the foundational skills</strong>; <strong>crafting a portfolio; and building a network of industry peers.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll go through all of these steps in detail, and more! We’ve broken this guide up into the following sections:</p>

<h2 id="1-what-does-a-user-experience-researcher-do">1. What does a user experience researcher do?</h2>
<p>The purpose of the UX researcher (also referred to as “user researcher” or “design researcher”) is to unearth human insights in order to guide the application of design.</p>
<p>According to a recent job posting by IBM, as a design researcher, you will “help provide actionable and meaningful data-driven insights that represent the voice of multiple users. You will collaborate across development, design, and marketing teams to evaluate current and upcoming user research needs that help to improve product definition and drive business goals.”</p>
<p>Some typical tasks and responsibilities of the UX researcher include:</p>
<h4 id="research-planning-and-recruitment">Research Planning and Recruitment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop a well-crafted research plan with clear research objectives.</li>
<li>Write usability research screeners and discussion guides.</li>
<li>Recruit targeted end-users for specific research studies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-collection">Data Collection </h4>
<ul>
<li>Moderate one-on-one basic usability sessions.</li>
<li>Help develop and implement quantitative surveys.</li>
<li>Conduct <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/ux-research-for-beginners/how-to-conduct-effective-user-interviews/">stakeholder and client interviews</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extract insights about user behaviors from web instrumentation tools.</li>
<li>Translate <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/ux-research-for-beginners/how-to-analyze-your-ux-research-findings/">user insights into actionable recommendations</a> for the product team.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="presentation-of-insights">Presentation of Insights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Craft personas and other “information radiators” (e.g. journey maps) to communicate insights across the design and development teams.</li>
<li>Present design research findings to the larger team in a clear and organized fashion.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Work closely with the product team to identify research objectives.</li>
<li>Establish and implement an overall research strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of tasks that belong to UX research. Ultimately, your job as a UX researcher is to build up a picture of your target users based on their needs, wants, motivations, and pain-points. These insights enable the wider design team to create user-friendly products based on real user feedback—not just your assumptions.</p>
<p>As with most UX design roles, the UX researcher means different things to different companies. To learn more about what might be expected of you as a UX researcher, browse various job sites and see how different companies advertise and describe the role. Here are some useful job portals to help you get started:</p>

<h2 id="2-what-skills-are-required-for-a-career-in-ux-research">2. What skills are required for a career in UX research?</h2>
<p>Now we’re familiar with some of the key tasks and responsibilities, let’s consider what skills are required for a career in UX research.</p>
<p>As such, being a UX researcher typically requires knowledge or experience in a relevant field that studies human behavior, such as cognitive science, behavioral economics, anthropology, sociology, or psychology. Ultimately, it’s important to be adept at reading people and empathizing with the user, and equally at home handling data and analytics.</p>
<p>Ideal candidates are typically “passionate, curious, and self-driven team players” who have experience working in fast-paced environments while applying both generative and evaluative research methods to build a larger understanding of users.</p>
<p>It’s also important to have a solid understanding of the design thinking process, as well as a passion and know-how for influencing design strategy. Obtaining these skills can be done through identifying research opportunities with a current employer, volunteering for a design project with an external organization (e.g. VolunteerMatch), or completing research for a personal project of your own. Overall, practice makes perfect, and refining these skills as often as you can will prepare you for your future role.</p>
<h2 id="3-how-to-expand-your-user-research-knowledge">3. How to expand your user research knowledge</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, there are four key steps to forging a career in UX research:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand your user research knowledge.</li>
<li>Obtain the foundational skills.</li>
<li>Craft a portfolio of experience.</li>
<li>Build a network of peers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start with that first step: <strong>Expanding your knowledge of the UX research field.</strong> In addition to browsing job descriptions, there are plenty of things you can do to learn more about the industry<em>—</em>but where to begin?</p>
<p>Start with the basics. <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-user-experience-ux-design-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/">What is user experience (UX) design?</a> <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-importance-of-user-research-and-how-to-do-it/">What is UX research and why is it so important?</a> From there, learn about the difference between qualitative, quantitative, attitudinal, and behavioural research. Next, you can familiarize yourself with some common UX research methods, such as card sorting, usability testing, and user interviews. You’ll find an introduction to some of the most important UX research methods in the video below (and be sure to <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/ux-research-for-beginners/">take a look at these free UX research tutorials</a>).</p>
<center><style type="text/css">.embed-container{position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%}.embed-container iframe,.embed-container object,.embed-container embed{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%}</style><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGZGDnTY454" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></center>
<p><br/>As part of your own research into the UX research field, you’ll also want to consider things such as <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-much-will-i-earn-as-a-ux-designer/" target="_blank">salary</a> and career options. Sites like Glassdoor and Payscale provide up-to-date salary reports for a range of different locations. If you can, reach out to people who are already donning the UX researcher job title. Do they tend to work remote or in-house? What kinds of companies employ UX researchers? Again, job sites can help you out here if you don’t have any contacts in the industry (yet!).</p>
<p>Before you commit to the UX researcher route, it’s important to learn as much as you can about the industry and what the role entails.</p>
<h2 id="4-how-to-obtain-the-foundational-skills-necessary-for-a-career-as-a-ux-researcher">4. How to obtain the foundational skills necessary for a career as a UX researcher</h2>
<p>If you’re keen to forge a career in UX research, you’ll need to start learning some of the key skills. As with any profession, it’s important to build a solid foundation of knowledge before jumping into real-world problem solving.</p>
<p>Assuming that you already have some knowledge in a related area (cognitive science, sociology, psychology, etc.), there are plenty of ways to learn the fundamentals of user research. Let’s consider those now.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Computer-Interaction-Empirical-Research-Perspective/dp/0124058655">Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Perspective</a>: learn about the foundational topics including historical context, the human factor, interaction elements, and the fundamentals of science and research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/User-Research-Practical-Designing-Products/dp/0749481048" target="_blank">User Research: A Practical Guide to Designing Better Products and Services</a>: learn about all the key research methods including face-to-face user testing, card sorting, surveys, and A/B testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="online-resources">Online resources</h4>
<p>Industry blogs are a great way to start learning the ins and outs of the field. Some useful (and trustworthy!) sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/research-methods/">Nielsen Norman Group</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/">UX Collective</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uxplanet.org/">UX Planet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uxmastery.com/">UX Mastery</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/" target="_blank">Inside Design</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conferences-and-meetups">Conferences and meetups</h4>
<p>If possible, consider attending a UX research conference or a local meetup. You’ll find <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/top-ux-research-conferences-to-attend-in-2019-23611236bc0">a list of the top UX research conferences to attend in 2019 here</a>, and can search for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/ux-research/">local UX research groups on meetup.com</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the examples above, finding an apprenticeship or a more senior researcher who is willing to let you shadow their process is a great way to immerse yourself in the context of a UX researcher while learning “on the job.”</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5c033ac567b18548f60093e6e9e6e4c40f19f697/3953f/en/blog/uploads/ux-researcher-doing-remote-research.jpg" alt="A user experience researcher reading a book" title="A user experience researcher reading a book"/></p>
<h2 id="5-how-to-craft-a-convincing-ux-research-portfolio">5. How to craft a convincing UX research portfolio</h2>
<p>As with any design role, a compelling portfolio is key to proving you’ve got the right skills for the job. So how do you go about creating a convincing <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ux-research-portfolio-guide/" target="_blank">UX research portfolio</a>? </p>
<p>As you practice refining your skills, keep a record of your work to present to future employers. Crafting an online portfolio is a great supplement to a resume or CV when highlighting case studies that show hiring managers what you can do. According to <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ux-design-portfolio-tips/">Senior UX Recruiter Tom Cotterill:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Your portfolio should show cultural suitability for the company where you are applying. Don’t be afraid to add a touch of character or your own style to your portfolio. It’s your chance to wow the hiring manager and demonstrate that you stand out from the crowd … A good portfolio indicates, in short, that this person has taken time to represent themselves in the best possible light, and they’re clued up enough to showcase their most relevant work in an aesthetic and logical way.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, your portfolio should include the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem or design challenge your research aimed to solve.</li>
<li>The team you collaborated with.</li>
<li>The research process (how did you go about solving the problem?).</li>
<li>The tools you used to recruit, collect and analyze data, and present insights.</li>
<li>The final outcome and handoffs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-how-to-build-a-network-within-the-ux-research-industry">6. How to build a network within the UX research industry</h2>
<p>You’re in the process of mastering the right skills and crafting your portfolio. Now it’s time to network! Networking is one of the best ways to meet people in the field and potentially land a new job.</p>
<p>Let’s consider some of the best opportunities for making industry connections.</p>
<h4 id="current-co-workers">Current Co-Workers</h4>
<p>If you are currently employed, look to see if there are any user experience researchers in your organization, and ask them what it’s like! Also request to shadow them during a research session and take notes.</p>
<h4 id="future-employers">Future Employers</h4>
<p>Informational interviews are also a great way to get candid feedback with people working at great companies, such as IBM, Google, or Amazon. Using LinkedIn or Twitter to find and invite UX researchers for coffee is a solid way to get an idea of what it may be like to work for your company of interest, and also how to get in the door.</p>
<h4 id="online-ux-communities">Online UX Communities</h4>
<p>Actively participate in online UX communities (e.g. Facebook groups) relevant to your professional interests and learning goals. Here are a few to start with:</p>
<ul>
