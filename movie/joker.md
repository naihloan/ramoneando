## Christopher Nolan on Directing The Joker | [Sep 7, 2019 The Director's Cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0bn18wSbI8)

I like how Heath Ledger explains that he took the part because he knew the world that Nolan had created and he had a card under his sleeve. I also like how Nolan states that he liked Ledger because he knew that he wouldn't take a part if he wasn't convinced of the role. The actor had not played many films. He accustomed to leave spaces of time between movies so that he could really be hungry for the next one.
