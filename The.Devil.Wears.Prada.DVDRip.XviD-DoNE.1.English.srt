You think this has nothing to do with you.
You go to your closet...
and you select- I don't know-
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...
because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously...
to care about what
you put on your back.
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...
that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.
And then I think it was
Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-
who showed cerulean military jackets?

- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.
And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores...
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...
where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.
However, that blue represents
millions of dollars...
and countless jobs...
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...
when, in fact...
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...
from a pile of stuff.
