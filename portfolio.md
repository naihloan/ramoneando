# My Web3 Product Portfolio

Here are some of my work, in the spirit of OnePage/OneHour[+](https://www.onepageonehour.com/about). Most things here belong to collective efforts. I share results, my thinking process, and projects as a Product Manager driving Web3 innovation. (Please don´t mind too much about the UI, I´m not a designer.)
