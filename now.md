# What I’m Doing Now

###### Last update: 2025-08-11

##### This is my "now" page, inspired by the [/now movement](https://nownownow.com/). Here’s what I’m up to.

# Work and Career
* Here are [my goals](/docs/benji-goals.pdf) for the next 5+ years
* **Looking for a new role as a Product Manager**  
* Here´s how I see that the market perceives me, and where I can provide the most value.  
_This is my **Candidate-Market Fit [CMF]:**_  
*I´m seeking a Product Manager role at an early stage startup in Series A, with focus on user experience (UX), on industries like wellbeing, social impact, and media.*
* I´ve drafted a [product portfolio](/portfolio/) to share ideas, collaboration and building mindset!

# Reading Books
- Diving into **UX**, **data**, and **culture**. It helps to sharpen my Product Management skills.
* I´ve read plenty of product and business books this year, along with cyber security and some music memoirs and bios.
* Check [my favorite books](/books/) for inspiration, if that helps.
* Exploring a book exchange app idea to connect readers: I saw this idea [in paper at a local book store.](/books/#project-inception-favorite-book-sharing)

# Reaching Out
* Do you know about [small blogging](https://jeremeyduvall.com/writing-on-the-web/) outside of the mainstream marketing sites?
* Do you know of other sites with pages like this one you´d like to share? 
* Let´s meet in-person here:
