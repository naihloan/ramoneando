# What I’m Doing Now

This is my "now" page, inspired by the [/now movement](https://nownownow.com/). Here’s what I’m up to.

# Work and Career
* Figuring out what to do, and how, for the next 5 years in Product
* Here are [my goals](/docs/benji-goals.pdf)
* **Looking for a new role as a Product Manager:**
> I´m seeking a Product Manager role at an early stage startup in Series A, with focus on user experience (UX), on industries like wellbeing, social impact, and media.
* I´ve drafted a product portfolio to share ideas, collaboration and building mindset!

# Music
* Playing Bass as a power trio with Sinapsys
* Playing my first live gigs later this year

# Reading books
* Diving more into UX, data, and culture.
* I´ve read plenty of product and business books this year, along with cyber security and some music memoirs and bios.
* I´ve built a section in this site: [books](/books/). Still not sure how to follow up on that one.

# Site 
* I learned some basic HTML code to build a site over 10+ years ago
* I prefer to know the code, not behind a no-code solution
* Now this is built with jekyll, ruby, markdown and HTML
* Quick startup pack in terminal: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
* Goto: [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

# Reaching Out
* Do you know about [small blogging](https://jeremeyduvall.com/writing-on-the-web/) outside of the mainstream marketing sites?
* Do you know of other sites with pages like this one you´d like to share? 
* Let´s meet in-person here:
