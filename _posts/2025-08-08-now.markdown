# Work and Career
* Figuring out [my goals](.docs/goals.pdf), for the next 5 years in Product
* I´ve drafted a [product portfolio](.docs/portfolio)
* The portfolio´s aim is to share ideas, collaboration and building mindset.
* **Looking for a new role as a Product Manager:**
> I´m seeking a Product Manager role at an early stage startup in Series A, with focus on design and user experience (UX), on industries like wellbeing, social impact, and media

# Music
* Playing Bass as a power trio with Sinapsys
* Playing my first live gigs later this year

# Reading books
* Diving more into UX, data, and culture.
* I´ve read plenty of product and business books this year, along with cyber security and some music memoirs and bios.

# Site
* I learned some basic HTML code to build a site over 10+ years ago
* I prefer to know the code, not behind a no-code solution
* Now this is built with jekyll and ruby
* Do you know about [small blogging](https://jeremeyduvall.com/writing-on-the-web/) outside of the mainstream marketing sites?
* Do you know of other sites with pages like this one you´d like to share?
