## Project Inception: Favorite Book Sharing

Imagine that you drop your 3 favorite books in exchange for my top 3. And so on. 
* Could that work?

Of course I´ve already shared them, but still a neat idea for a digital app. I saw it in person at a physical book store with pen and paper to exchange with people you don´t meet: a bit of a anonymous pen pal kind of thing. Mysterious, random and fun.
