Absolutely everyone who is an entrepreneur or wants to be one needs to
read this book. I first read it after 10 years of successfully running
my company, and was still blown away and totally humbled by its wisdom.
Re-reading it today, I'm amazed how my view of business was completely
changed by this one little book. See my notes for examples, but
definitely read the book itself to get the real impact.

my notes
--------

Fatal assumption : if you understand the technical work of a business,
you understand a business that does that technical work.\
The technical work of a business, and a business that does that
technical work are two totally different things.\
The technician is forced to learn how to make the business work, rather
than do the work himself.\
\
Every technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences
the same thing:\
1. Exhiliration, 2. Terror, 3. Exhaustion, 4. Despair - a terrible sense
of loss, loss of special relationship with their work, loss of purpose,
loss of self.\
\
\
== ENTREPRENEUR, MANAGER, TECHNICIAN\
\
Everybody who goes into business is actually three people in one:\
The Entrepreneur dreams\
The Manager frets\
The Technician ruminates\
While each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them
wants to have a boss.\
\
The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the
present. He's happiest when left free to construct images of "what if"
and "if when".\
In business, the Entrepreneur is the innovator, grand strategist,
creator of new methods.\
Given his need for change, the Entrepreneur creates a great deal of
havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists
in his projects.\
The entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it's done begins
planning the next one.\
\
The Manager craves order, compulsively clings to the status quo. While
entrepreneur sees opportunities, manager sees the problems.\
The Manager creates neat orderly rows of things. The Entrepreneur
creates the things that the manager puts in rows.\
The Manager is the one who runs after the Entrepreneur to clean up the
mess. Without the Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up.\
\
Technician is the doer : "if you want something done right, do it
yourself".\
As long as the Technician is working, he is happy, but only on one thing
at a time. He knows he can't get things done simultaneously, so he works
steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow.\
\
If the three were equally balanced, we'd be describing an incredibly
competent individual.\
The Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of
interest.\
The Manager would be solidifying the base of operations.\
The Technician would be doing the technical work.\
\
Without all three of these personalities being given opportunity, the
freedom, the nourishment they each need to grow, your business cannot
help but mirror your own lopsidedness.\
\
An Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something
apart from you, the owner. The work of asking all the right questions
about WHY this business, opposed to that business?\
\
\
== INFANCY\
\
Unfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what
the business needs.\
It's easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are one
and the same.\
Infancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run
the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change. This is
where most business failures occur.\
\
If your business depends on you, you don't own a business - you have a
job. (and you're working for a lunatic)\
The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can
create jobs for other people.\
\
== ADOLESCENCE\
\
Error: Management by abdication ("To relinquish formally a high office
or responsibility.") rather than delegation.\
The process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is
not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well.\
\
\
== BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE\
\
True trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.\
To know, one must understand.\
To understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions
are truly present. What people know, do, want, are - and what they
don't/aren't.\
A business that "gets small again" is a business reduced to the level of
its owner's personal resistance to change - its owner's comfort zone.
(works and waits for something positive to happen)\
Businesses that "get small again" die, implode.\
Your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.\
To educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and
structure can carry the additional weight.\
\*\* It's up to you to dictate your business's rate of growth by
understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key
objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you're aiming for
in the marketplace.\
Write it down, clearly, so others can understand it. (If you can't, you
don't own it!)\
\
\
== MATURITY\
\
Maturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases. It is not
the end of a serial process. Great companies didn't end up as mature
companies - they started out that way.\
Mature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go
through them in a different way. It's the perspective that makes the
difference.\
Very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done.
How it would act.\
Unless you act that way from the beginning, you'll never get there. In
order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it
ever becomes one.\
Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing
business. We didn't do business at IBM, we built one.\
The very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that
works.\
\
How must the business work?\
Business as a system for producing outside results - for the customer -
resulting in profits.\
Picture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with
the intention of changing it to match the vision.\
\
Survey the world and ask, "Where is the opportunity?"\
Identify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution
to the frustration found in a group of customers.\
Acts the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur.\
"How will my business look to the customer?" "How will my business stand
out from all the rest?"\
Within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to
be satisfied. Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in
the future.\
\
\
== THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION / FRANCHISE PROTOTYPE\
\
A systems-dependent business, not a people-dependent business.\
Integrity : doing what you say you will do, and if you can't : learning
how.\
\
Franchise prototype is where all assumptions are put to the test to see
how well they work before becoming operational in the business.\
The system runs the business. The people run the system.\
The system isn't something you bring to the business. It's something you
derive from the process of building the business.\
Entrepreneur : franchise prototype is the medium through which vision
takes form in the real world.\
Manager : franchise prototype provides the order, predictability,
system.\
Technician : franchise prototype is where he is free to do the things he
loves to do : the technical work.\
\
\
== WORKING ON YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN IT\
\
Your business is not your life.\
Your business is something apart from you, with its own rules and its
own purposes. An organism that will live or die according to how well it
performs its sole function : find and keep customers.\
The primary purpose of your business is to serve your life (not
vice-versa)\
Make a perfect prototype for 5000 more just like it. Exactly like it,
not just similar.\
Franchise model:\
1. provides consistent value to customers, employees, etc - beyond what
they expect\
2. operated by people with the lowest possible skill\
3. a place of impecable order\
4. all work documented in operations manuals\
5. provides uniformly predictable service to the customer\
6. uses uniform color, dress, facilities code\
\
Lowest possible level of skill necessary to fulfill the functions for
which each is intended. Of course, in a legal firm you need attorneys,
medical, physicians. But you don't need to hire brilliant attorneys or
physicians.\
Create the very best system through which good attorneys and good
physicians can be leveraged to produce exquisite results.\
\
How can I give my customer the results he wants systematically rather
than personally?\
How can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather
than people-dependent or expert-dependent?\
How can I create an expert system rather than hire one?\
\
Great business are not built by extraordinary people, but by ordinary
people doing extraordinary things.\
\
Develop those tools and teach your people how to use them.\
People's job is to use the tools you've developed and recommend
improvements based on their experience with them.\
\
NO : Typical owner of a small business prefers highly skilled people
because he believes they make his job easier - he can simply leave the
work to them.\
Unfortunately then the business grows to depend on the whims and moods
of its people.\
If they're in the mood, the job gets done. If they're not, it doesn't.\
In this kind of business, "How do I motivate my people?" comes up : "How
do I keep them in the mood?"\
It is literally impossible to create a consistent result in a business
that depends on extraordinary people.\
When you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary
people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to
produce a result without the extraordinary ones.\
You will be forced to find a system that leverages your ordinary people
to the point where they can produce extraordinary results over and over
again.\
You will be forced to invent innovative system solutions to the people
problems that plague businesses.\
You will be forced to build a business that works.\
\
Documentation says, "This is how we do it here."\
Without documentation, all routinized work turns into exceptions.\
Designates the purpose of the work, specifies the steps needed to be
taken while doing that work, and summarizes the standards associated
with both the process and result.\
\
BARBER story : He was constantly and arbitrarily changing my experience
for me. He was in control of my experience, not I. Running the business
for him, not me. Deprived me of the experience of making a decision to
patronize his business for my own reasons. It didn't matter what I
wanted.\
What you do in your model is not as important as doing what you do the
same way, each and every time.\
\
\* How can I get my business to work without me?\
\* How can I get my people to work without my interference?\
\* How can I systematize my business so it could be replicated thousands
of times?\
\* How can I own my business, and still be free of it?\
\* How can I spend my time doing the work I love to do rather than the
work I have to do?\
\
\
== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\
\
People constantly asking, "What is the best way to do this?" - knowing
we'll never discover the best way, but by asking we discover a better
way.\
Innovation is the "best way" skill. It produces a high level of energy
in every company.\
\
Quantification : numbers related to the impact an innovation makes.\
Quantify EVERYTHING related to how you do business.\
Eventually, you and your people will think of your entire business in
terms of the numbers.\
Read your business' health chart by the flow of the numbers.\
Know which numbers are critical and which aren't.\
Become as familiar with your business' numbers as a doctor is with blood
pressure / pulse rates.\
Without the numbers, you don't know where you are or where you're
going.\
With the numbers, your business will take on a totally new meaning.\
\
Orchestration is the elimination of discretion or choice at the
operating level of your business.\
Without orchestration, nothing could be planned or anticipated by you or
your customer.\
If you're doing everything differently every time you do it, if everyone
is doing it at their own discretion, you're creating chaos, not order.\
If you haven't orchestrated it, you don't own it.\
If you don't own it, you can't depend on it.\
Unless your unique way of doing business can be replicated every single
time, you don't own it.\
Unless your customer gets everything he wants every time, he'll go
someplace else to get it.\
The business development process is not static - it's not something you
do and then are done with - it's something you do all the time.\
\
Innovation, Quantification, Orchestration are the backbone of a business
- the Business Development Process.\
\
\
== BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\
\
Your...\
1. Primary Aim\
2. Strategic Objective\
3. Organizational Strategy\
4. Management Strategy\
5. People Strategy\
6. Marketing Strategy\
7. Systems Strategy\
\
== PRIMARY AIM:\
What do I value most?\
What kind of life do I want?\
What do I want my life to look like, to feel like?\
How do I wish my day-to-day to be?\
What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my
life?\
Who do I wish to be?\
How would I like to be with other people in my life : my family,
friends, business associates, customers, employees?\
How would I like people to think about me?\
2 years from now? 10? 20? End of life?\
What specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually,
physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about
relationships?\
\
Begin living your life as if it were important. Take it seriously.
Create it intentionally.\
\
== STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:\
\
Your strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business
has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.\
\
The first standard is gross revenues. How big will your company be when
it's finally done? Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax
profits.\
You can't know all this, but any standards are better than no
standards.\
Does the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by
a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while?\
Central demographic model : a most probable customer.\
\
== ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY\
\
The organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can
have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single
business development step.\
More companies organize around personalities rather than around
functions. (& the result is chaos)\
Make a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP
Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production
manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable
manager, Accounts payable manager. (clear tree of who reports to who)\
A position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each
position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a
list of standards by which results are to be evaluated. Sign off on it.
Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee,
and a summary of the rules of the game. It provides each person with a
sense of commitment and accountability.\
\
Look at each position as a franchise prototype of its own.\
When one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position,
implementing the business development process of innovation,
quantification, orchestration.\
\
Don't hire someone with experience. Not a master technician. A novice, a
beginner, an apprentice. Someone eager to learn how to do it right.
Willing to learn what you've spent so much time and energy discovering.
Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed
yet, skills he/she wants to learn.\
\
If you don't obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you
expect anyone else to take your game seriously?\
\
\
== MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\
\
You may think your plan depends on highly skilled people. It doesn't.
You don't need such people. You can't afford them. They will become the
bane of your existence.\
What you need is a mangement system.\
The system will become your management strategy, and produces the
results you want.\
The system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable
people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are
made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible.\
\
A management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce
a marketing result.\
The more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise
prototype will be.\
Management development - the process through which you create your
management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn't a
management tool - it's a marketing tool.\
Its purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an
effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better
than any other.\
(HOTEL STORY HERE)\
\
\
== PEOPLE STRATEGY\
\
"How do I get my people to do what I want?"\
You can't get your people to do anything.\
If you want it done, create an environment where "doing it" is more
important to them than not doing it. Where "doing it" well becomes a way
of life.\
The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we're sloppy at it,
it's because we're sloppy inside. If we're late, it's because we're late
inside. If we're bored, we're bored inside.\
The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist.\
So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves.\
Make sure they understand the idea behind the work they're being asked
to do. An idea more important than the work itself.\
Everyone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he
can possibly be at the tasks he's accountable for. When he can't do
that, he should act like he is. If unwilling to act, leave.\
A business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you
go to practice being the best you can be.\
A game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the
owner, have about the world.\
The degree to which they buy into your game doesn't depend on them but
on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the
relationship - not after it's begun.\
Your People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea.\
\
1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do. The
game has to come first, what your people do comes second. (?)\
2. Never create a game you're unwilling to play yourself.\
3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it.
(never actually end it, but give occasional victories)\
4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy.
(any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was.
anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive
action)\
5. Remind people of the game, constantly. Once a week, have a meeting
about the game. Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception
to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows
about it.\
6. The game has to make sense.\
7. The game needs to be fun from time to time. (not all the time)\
8. If you can't think of a good game, steal one.\
\
The hiring process is the first and most essential medium for
communicating the Boss' idea.\
HIRING:\
1. scripted presentation communicating the Boss' idea in a group meeting
to all the applicants at once. describe the idea, history, successful
experience implementing the idea, attributes required of the successful
candidate for the position.\
2. meeting with each applicant individually to discuss reactions and
feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. ask
why they feel they're great for the role in implementing the idea.\
3. notify successful candidate by phone.\
4. notify unsuccessful applicants, thanking for their interest.\
5. first day of training:\
- reviewing boss' idea\
- summarizing the system\
- take a tour of facilities, highlighting people at work, systems at
work, to demonstrate the interdependence of systems on people and people
on systems\
- answering employee's questions fully\
- give operations manual\
- review operations manual\
- completing employment papers\
\
Don't hire experienced managers, because they'll manage by standards
they learned somewhere else.\
You must take full accountability for what's going on in your business.
You must lead the company in the direction you intend it to go.\
You must set the standard.\
The Management System : all managers and future-managers are expected to
produce results.\
You don't need professional managers to manage to those standards : just
people who wish to learn how to manage them. People who are personally
committed to those standards as you are.\
\
You need people who want to play your game. Not people who believe they
have a better one.\
\
Hierarchy of systems: (where the "it" is the stated purpose of your
business.)\
1 : how we do it here\
2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here\
3 : how we manage it here\
4 : how we change it here\
\
\
== MARKETING STRATEGY:\
\
When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It's what your
customer wants that matters.\
What your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he
wants.\
Make a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise
better than anyone else on the block.\
The COO is the driver of all of this. The COO connects each part of the
business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole.\
\
\
== SYSTEMS STRATEGY:\
\
A system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that
interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems. (?)\
\
Information is the glue that holds your system strategy together. It
tells you when and why you need to change.\
