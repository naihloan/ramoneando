<h2>Distance athlete's aeffect on urban rhythm: <br>
how do ultrarunners run in automatized cities? </h2> <br>

<h4>Context </h4> <br>

<p> 
Millions of persons run today in any urban scenario:
they just put their clothes and go.
It's crucial to feel the body when running.
And this does not imply that this attention and perception is always a given.
In July of 2015 an athlete in Frankfurt finished an Ironman (a triathlon that takes 11 hours in average to complete).
The participant dies after being convalescent due to over hydration/hyponathremia.
The issue raised here is that certain sport practices involve health care that goes beyond the daily kind.
The problem is that this kind of learning becomes vital: that is, of life or death.

<br> <br> 

Running, however, is seldom a high risk activity.
It generally contributes elements to fight against obesity, depression, and a long list.
But it's also used as a lucrative activity by an industry that produces sport supplies and an apparatus of organization that hosts a variety of events:
short races, olympic marathon distance (42.195 k) and ultramarathons that go up to a an amount that may seem infinite such as the 246 k Spartathlon, and even races that can last 48 continuous hours.
<br> <br> 

The longest challenges, aside from posing the question of public physical (and mental!) health,
need to use the urban and wild spaces in a agile, free, and articulate way.
This also detonates in a exploitation of natural and touristic resources that staggers between environmental care and decay.
UNESCO for example looks to take care of Mont Blanc, place of the emblamatic ultramarathon Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, as a World Heritage Site.
<br><br>
 
People who run experiments the activity in many different manners:
as meditation in motion, to listen music,
take off some colesterol from blood, experience the vitality of their body/mind,
to clear their head and/or gaze at the green landskape in a fraction of the city.
``Just buy a good pair of shoes and you're ready'' say many who promote the activity that is less sedentary and pretty cheap:
(almost) for free one would be tempted to say.
<br> <br> 

<h4>Research topic and subject of analysis</h4> <br>

It would seem at a first glance that all the social and biological mechanics of functioning of running just works in auto-pilot.
And however, several controversies open from different sides.
The popular book ``Born to Run'' suggests that the Mexican Indians, the Raramuri of the Tarahamura mountains, run today in the same way as it has been during four centuries.
<br><br>

The custom/trend to run arises half a century ago, together with sport accessories and recommendations to use shoes to that end.
In a wider specter, these activities are inserted in a vast world of shortages and excesses.
On one side, shortages of active options to the dormant body in an economic system in which desk jobs prevail, and leisure of passive consumption.
On the other side, excesses of search with vivid attention, fun, fatigue and the exploration of the limits of the body when activated.
The bodily biology opens up to new sensations.
The body becomes a centrifugal machine: it becomes necessary to analyze the outcoming bodily fluids, the salinity of transpiration,
urine color indicative of hydration, fecal matter that shows the gastric processes.
The body as centripetal machine seeks for a nourishment that allows running for hundreds of kilometers, and the knowledge to not die trying.
<br><br>

The individual and collective bodies take the challenge to affect their ability and desire to act.
There are even those who hold that it is not even necessary to use shoes to run, it would be enough to just simply use your legs, and barefoot feet.
This is supported by several athletes, academics and even a small fraction of the industry that look for innovation (or going back to basics) 
with minimalist footwear: with low or no heel height.
<br><br>

Is it really necessary to use shoes? 
Some studies suggest that there are movements that avoid injuries:
for example to run landing with the ball of the feet (metatharsi), instead of using the heel.
This type of bodily mechanics is one of the topics that the paleoanthropologist Daniel Lieberman has researched for over a decade.
Runners learn technical resources and make them their own from different sources: nutritional, mechanic, motivational.
But each person use them, make them, and tailor the resources in their own way: they <em>singularize</em> them, they learn how to run in a unique way.
In this point the experimentation of athletes become key.
The whole of the runners world would also affect the urban rhythms, slowing them down and accelerating them, intervening in the physical city and the way spaces are used.
In sum, the objectives of this research are as follow.
<br><br>

<strong>General Objective</strong><br>
 Search how people learn to manage resources/knowledge and take risks to do activities that the majority ignores how to carry on.
 Runners of ultramarathon are not superhumans: they develop a know-how and find interest in the methods for running to an extreme extent.<br><br>
<strong>Specific Objectives</strong><br>
    - Take into account the progresive information that ultrarunners in a community handle in specific events.<br>
    - Review the impact of running styles related to injury-health, and the relationship with running gear (and lack of) <br>
    - Consider the motivations to run beyond a health goal (even risking life) and the mental and spiritual levels that get mobilized.<br>
    - Detail the particularities and differences of an ultramarathon event in comparison to shorter races.<br>
    - Seek the movement of the athletes through public space as an opposite direction against standarized and massive urban rhythms, placing the general mobility as a limitation to body and social development.<br><br>


<h4>Materials and methods</h4> <br>

This work looks to a wider spectrum of mechanisms of escape from the inertia of the productive system,
a production of machinic uselessness, where cars and public transportation <em>circulates, overpopulates and congests</em>,
all which controls movements in favor of an economic and political order and power.

Es evidente que cosas tan diferentes como el monopolio o la especialización de la mayor
parte de los conocimientos médicos, la complicación del motor del automóvil, el
gigantismo de las máquinas, no corresponden a ninguna necesidad tecnológica, sino
solamente a imperativos económicos y políticos que se proponen concentrar potencia y
control en las manos de una clase dominante (Deleuze y Guattari, 2010: 527).

Ultrarunners are the case study. However, the implications of the topic go beyond this social world.
A good amount of ultrarunners are so conscious of the need for natural food that they have a bigger inclination to eat more fruits and vegetables than average people and in some cases are even close to or even long term vegetarians.
This is related, but apart, from massive consumption patterns, of how to avoid the dangers of canned foods,
with conservatives, refined sugars, processed flour; and a political view that implies requesting the land to be distributed and cultivated to food people and not animals.
<br><br>

The proposal is of qualitative research.
On one side, it will nurture from secondary material in texts and videos made by and about the participants of ultramarathon races.
On the other side, first hand material will be carried on with participant observation.
As study material the general training method shall be reviewed and at least the ethnography of one specific competition.
These elements pursue to give new life to the ideas of how people move,
beyond a mere translation function, and how urban spaces can be circulated, expanding their uses.

Esto es por conocimiento de las condiciones de medioambiente de la carrera y factibilidad de ejecución por ser de una distancia de 50 kms. Y después se podrá evaluar la repetición en eventos anuales siguientes o en otras localidades. -->
