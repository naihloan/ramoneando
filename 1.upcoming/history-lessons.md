# Why don't we learn from history?

## B. H. Liddell Hart (1895-1970) 

### Foreword

<http://infohost.nmt.edu/~shipman/reading/liddell/foreword.html>

 Over two thousand years ago, Polybius, the soundest of ancient historians, began his History with the remark that “the most instructive, indeed the only method of learning to bear with dignity the vicissitude of fortune, is to recall the catastrophes of others.” History is the best help, being a record of how things usually go wrong.

A long historical view not only helps us to keep calm in a “time of trouble” but reminds us that there is an end to the longest tunnel. Even if we can see no good hope ahead, an historical interest as to what will happen is a help in carrying on. For a thinking man, it can be the strongest check on a suicidal feeling.

### Conclusions

   collective growth is possibly only through the
   freedom and enlargement of individual minds. It is not the man, still less the mass, that
   counts, but the many.

   Once the collective importance of each individual in helping or hindering progress is
   appreciated, the experience contained in history is seen to have a personal, not merely a
   political, significance. What can the individual learn from history—as a guide to living?
   Not what to do but what to strive for. And what to avoid in striving. The importance and
   intrinsic value of behaving decently. [...]
   
   He may realize that the world is a jungle. But if he has seen that it could be better for
   anyone if the simple principles of decency and kindliness were generally applied, then he
   must in honesty try to practice these consistently and to live, personally, as if they
   were general. In other words, he must follow the light he has seen.

   Since he will be following it through a jungle, however, he should bear in mind the
   supremely practical guidance provided nearly two thousand years ago: “Behold, I send you
   forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
   doves.”
