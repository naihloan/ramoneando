# [Flight of the Conchords - Hurt feelings (Tears of a rapper)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lg51dzWHJE)

Some people say that rappers don't have feelings.
We have feelings.
(We have feelings)
Some people say that we are not rappers.
(We're rappers)
That hurt our feelings.
(Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers.)

Some people say that rappers are invincible
(we're vincible.)
We're vincible.
What you are about to hear are true stories.
(Real experiences)
Autobiographical raps.
(Things that happened to us.)
All true, bring the rhyme(s)!

I make a meal for my friends, try to make it delicious.
Try to keep it nutritious.
Create wonderful dishes.
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel.
No body compliments the meal.

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
I feel like a prize asshole,
No one even mentions my casserole.
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
Could have said something nice about my profiteroles.

Here's a little story to put a tear to your eye.
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive.
But every suit I tried was to big around the thighs,
and the assistant suggested I'd try a ladies size.

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
I'm not gonna wear a ladies wetsuit. I'm a man!
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
Get me a small mans wetsuit please.

It's my birthday, 2003
Waiting for a call from my family.
They forgot about me.

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, mum.

I call my friends, say let's go into town.
But they're all to busy to go into town.
So I go by myself, I go in to town
Then I see all my friends, They're all in town.

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
They're all lined up to watch that movie, 'Maid in Manhattan.'

Have you ever been told that your ass is to big?
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
Have you ever been told you got a weird shaped head?

Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
And once again, have they forgot about jay?
Were you ever called homo, cause at school you took drama?
have you ever been told that you look like a llama?

Tears of a rapper.
(Tears of a rapper.)
I'm crying tears of a rapper.
(Tears of a rapper.)
