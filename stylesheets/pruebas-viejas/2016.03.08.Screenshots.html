[–]dfollett76 899 points 6 months ago <br>
The book of Jonah is pretty cool. Yes, there's the whole big fish thing but I think it's funny how Jonah is upset that he saved the town of Ninevah. He wanted to fail because he hated the Ninevites.<br><br>

[–]theAlpacaLives 435 points 6 months ago <br>
Everyone loves the bit about being swallowed by a fish, but for me the heart of the story is later, when Jonah's just camping outside the city, and he can't wait to watch the fire and brimstone fall, and it doesn't. For those that haven't read it: a big leafy vine comes up in the desert and shades him from the sun, but a worm eats at it and it dies. Jonah, already upset at the delay in God's judgment on the wicked foreign city of Ninevah, yells at God about killing the plant, and God says: you want me to care about this stupid weed -- but you can't allow me to have mercy on the million lives in this huge city? And on that rhetorical question, the book ends. Beautiful.
<br><br>

[–]Stories-With-Bears 38 points 6 months ago <br>
I've always liked how when God asks Jonah if he's really that upset about the plant, Jonah replies "I am angry enough to die." So hilarious and overly dramatic, but also so relatable.

It's not really a 'story' but I like the book of Ecclesiastes. It's basically existential philosophy in bible form. I mean the first sentence is (depending on your translation) 'Meaningless, meaningless, all is meaningless.'<br><br>

Papers are still behind a paywall. You pretty much pay them for editing, hosting, and arranging a peer review (asking another specialist in your field to comment on your work and suggest improvements) <br>

Also, during Jobsearch and proposal writing,Funding agencies and Universities are mostly looking on peer reviewed papers or specific publications, as these are more prestige and have a higher impact. But yeah, most people think that publicly funded research should be also publicly available.

Recommendations of "well written" history books. (self.history)<br>
submitted 6 months ago * by dohrey <br>

I have always found that is quite rare to find writers who are both excellent historians (i.e. their work is well-researched and convincing, not necessarily that they are ground-breaking academics) and excellent writers. I have recently been captivated by books by Tom Holland, Roger Crowley, and Andrew Roberts who I feel fulfill both criteria.<br>

I was wondering if /r/history had any other recommendations of authors who write well (turning histories into page turners) and have done the homework to back it up!<br><br>

[–]phamm87 264 points 6 months ago <br>
Guns of August is, in my humble opinion, the greatest history book ever written. I also believe WWI to be the most "underreported/undertaught" event in human history, especially in the U.S.A. Given the impact that the event had on the next 100 years of history, it's interesting to read about the finer details of what happened.<br> <br>

sleepyti.me - Site that helps you figure out when to wake up, or fall asleep, to feel refreshed when you awake. Based on REM cycles. (sleepyti.me)
submitted 6 months ago by VintageCorduroy <br><br>

[–]darkcode 1148 points 6 months ago*x2 <br>
Hi, guys. I'm the person who made 
<a href="sleepyti.me" target="_blank">sleepyti.me</a>.
<br>
First of all, thank you for all the kind words -- and also for the critique. There are a few points I'd like to address.<br>
I made sleepyti.me about five years ago for my own personal use. I always woke up groggy, and one night I thought I'd be extra responsible and go to sleep earlier. You can imagine how frustrated I was when I woke up even more tired than my normal bed time. I'd gotten more sleep, so I thought I'd wake up feeling better. Not only was I wrong, but I couldn't figure out <em>why</em> I was wrong.<br>
After researching online, and -- yes -- speaking with both physicians and sleep scientists, I was introduced to the concept of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_inertia" target="_blank">sleep inertia</a>. Sleep inertia, as a basic idea, states that waking up from a deep sleep is more difficult than waking up from a light sleep. It's something that seems obvious when you think about it, but it wasn't something I'd ever considered before. I started doing math on paper before bed -- just trying to figure out the optimal time to sleep based on when I needed to wake up -- and I noticed it made an amazing difference. It wasn't exact, of course; I've never done a sleep study, so it's almost certain that my sleep cycles aren't exactly 90 minutes, but the effects were absolutely noticable.<br>
After doing this for a few weeks (and, admittedly, telling some of my friends how much it helped), several people I knew asked if I could make a simple webapp so that they could try it, too. Sure, I thought. I already wanted to learn web design.<br>
I made sleepyti.me over the course of the next several weeks, and launched it in November 2010. Since then, I've spoken to many sleep scientists, doctors, and neurologists (not sure why some people think this is pseudo-scientific), who have confirmed that while not 100% accurate, the concept is sound. I've been lucky enough to have some exposure to news outlets (like 
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/test-run-sleepytime-a-bedtime-calculator/?_r=1" target="_blank">The New York Times </a> and
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5870109/sleepytime-calculates-the-best-time-to-go-to-sleep-so-you-wake-up-refreshed" target="_blank"> Lifehacker</a>), and I've received many, many notes from people who benefit from sleepyti.me.<br>
About a month ago, I completed this latest redesign (and actual re-write of the site), in order to make the design responsive on any device. I changed the color to a deep blue so that people don't have to stare at white screens before bed. I know that if your sleep cycles are way off, that this app won't work for you -- but my goal here is really just to help people, so that they can wake up refreshed just like me. It's been almost five years, and I still use sleepyti.me almost every night.<br>
Thanks to everyone who's used sleepyti.me, and to the people who are skeptical: I don't blame you at all -- I was skeptical of the concept myself. Give it a shot, sometime, though... you might be pleasantly surprised at the results :)

I'll go against the grain and say the biggest thing you're missing isn't some artist or genre but the medium in which you can discover good music. I have no idea what your taste is and knowing nothing about you I can't recommend any artist but what I can do is recommend apps like to pandora and spotify. The biggest thing to hit the music industry in the past decade isnt some up and coming artist but the means in which we discover them. Music is more accessible than ever and it's just waiting for you to discover something you like.
EDIT: Medium instead of median
EDIT 2: Since this blew up there are way more websites/apps such as 8tracks, Soundcloud, songza, deezer, and banpcamp. Google the website and search the artist/genre and get lost in how exponentially better the internet has made finding music you love

<p>This has been happening for decades and it is abundantly clear those who wield these powers over the citizenry will not give them up or investigate themselves for wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The only check to that power is the citizenry banding together and dispensing justice when the courts refuse to do so.</p>

<p>Spread awareness, organize, and toss out these corrupt DA/prosecutors/cops. Alternatively, torch their ill gotten gains or if need be, lynch them.</p>

<p>These corrupt figures make a mockery of justice and every time they get away with such egregious acts, it just serves to reinforce their belief that they&#39;re untouchable.</p>

<p>EDIT - Appending a response for visibility.</p>

<!-- <hr/> -->

<p>Violence has always been a fix.</p>

<p>The struggle between the leaders and their constituents have been ongoing since time immemorial.</p>

<p>Whether it is peasants and serfs revolting against taxes or unjust laws in the middle ages or rioting for injustices caused by corrupt DAs and cops, the thing those in power fear most is violence.</p>

<p>Those in power do not give you rights because they&#39;re humanitarians or just. </p>

<p>Our forefathers fought, bled and died for those rights, whether it&#39;s the founding of the nation, or workers&#39; rights, or civil rights, violence has always been at the forefront of liberty and justice.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate people have been brainwashed into thinking otherwise but that is the way it has been and always will be.</p>

<p>One of the most common responses to this is &quot;Look at Martin Luther King! Civil disobedience!&quot;</p>

<p>From wiki -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Birmingham was only one of over a hundred cities rocked by chaotic protest that spring and summer, some of them in the North. <strong>During the March on Washington, Martin Luther King would refer to such protests as &quot;the whirlwinds of revolt.&quot;</strong> In Chicago, blacks rioted through the South Side in late May after a white police officer shot a fourteen-year-old black boy who was fleeing the scene of a robbery.[87] Violent clashes between black activists and white workers took place in both Philadelphia and Harlem in successful efforts to integrate state construction projects.[88][89] On June 6, over a thousand whites attacked a sit-in in Lexington, North Carolina; blacks fought back and one white man was killed.[90][91] Edwin C. Berry of the National Urban League warned of a complete breakdown in race relations: <strong>&quot;My message from the beer gardens and the barbershops all indicate the fact that the Negro is ready for war.&quot;[87]</strong></p>

<p>In their deliberations during this wave of protests, the Kennedy administration privately felt that militant demonstrations were ʺbad for the countryʺ and that &quot;Negroes are going to push this thing too far.&quot;[93] On May 24, Robert Kennedy had a meeting with prominent black intellectuals to discuss the racial situation. <strong>The blacks criticized Kennedy harshly for vacillating on civil rights, and said that the African-American community&#39;s thoughts were increasingly turning to violence</strong>. The meeting ended with ill will on all sides.[94][95][96] <strong><em>Nonetheless, the Kennedys ultimately decided that new legislation for equal public accommodations was essential to drive activists &quot;into the courts and out of the streets.&quot;[93][97]</em></strong></p>
