% "I'm often asked what I think about as I run. Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves. I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I'm running? I don't have a clue." -- Murakami ~\cite{murakami2009talk}
% 
% "When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. This is a part of my day I can't do without."
% -- Murakami ~\cite{murakami2009talk}
