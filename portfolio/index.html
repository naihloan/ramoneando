				Why is it hard for Latin America NGOs to keep engagement with their public? We aimed to resolve this and give a more continuous engagement between volunteers and NGOs.

				We need to best understand what do NGOs look like in the Web3 space and how they raise funding: none of them had a reputation system, which can foster trust and more collaboration. 
				In this web3 event in Buenos Aires, we recorded our pitch-deck, to propose that building such a system can engage users at a more personal and sustained way.
