<!-- <p>I received some insights from an Informant who is living in the same area as I do. He is outside of the area of fieldwork, but lived down there South many years working with hitchhikers: Gustavo Giorgis. He gave some recommendations and contacts for the area, both in or near Chaltén and Calafate. In total I completed a numbered list of 24 options but also added several other mentions that could also be considered.</p> -->
<h3 id="chaltén-and-around">Chaltén and around</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Monte Fitz Roy. Main attraction of the area. It is possible to go directly, do sightseeing, or just contemplate from afar since many tours have this sight as background: hikes, rafting tours, and so on.</li>
<del><li>Lago/Laguna del Desierto. Resolved conflict of frontiers with Chile by 1994. There is a master degree work that speaks about mountaineers between both countries, but does not focus in Patagonia. (Antonio Palumbo 2014, I can hand it to you if needed).</li></del>
<li>Glaciar Vespigniani. Mountain trekking through unexplored area.</li>
<li>Glaciar Viedma. &quot;Less touristic&quot;. 3 full hours of Ice Trekk.</li>
<del><li>La Leona. Ex-Estación Astronómica Austral. This may be seriously outdated, since all astronomy these days is in Bariloche. But still may have some useful information on the science and society of the area.</li></del>
<li>A small <em>occupied</em> space. This means standing in a territory, be it a home/building, or a piece of land. We would need to check distance from where we are. * Note: <em>Ocupa</em> de bigotes in Chaltén, ask Rolo de Torres del Paine).</li>
<li class="small"> <a href="https://www.rivendelchalten.com/la-waffleria/"> <mark>La Wafflería</mark> </a> / Waffle House. Waffles have not been historically a thing in Argentina. In some cool and touristic places they have been developing for the last two decades. May show some idea of international tourism. Since house is in English there might be a chance that they speak in English. <strong>Contacted</strong> November 14:	wrote email.</li>
<li class="small"> <mark>Camila &amp; Luciano</mark>. I went to an all-outdoor store where I live to pick up my number for a running race in the mountains. There I found a magazine, from which I searched their website and found some guides in our research area. <a href="http://kooch.com.ar/destinos/guias">Kooch Online Magazine</a> &gt; <a href="https://pataguides.com/trekking/">Trekking guides</a> Options: Mountaineering | Trekking | Ski Touring | Ice Climbing | Rock Climbing. <strong>Contacted</strong> November 13:	wrote email. November 14 replied. November 15 I replied and we both have each others phone number to arrange date and details.</li>
<del><li>Poincenot <a href="https://issuu.com/revista_kooch/docs/kooch_58">Climbing</a>. Same magazine (kooch#58) mentions a place to visit near Chaltén. &quot;Dios los cría y el viento los junta&quot; &gt; &quot;Dios los cría y Chaltén los amontona&quot;</li></del>
</ol>
<ul>
<li class="small"><a href="https://www.estanciacristina.com/#excursiones"> <mark>Estancia Cristina</mark></a>. [Calafate]
<strong>Contacted</strong> November 13:	wrote email.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.estanciaelcondor.com/#4">Estancia el Condor</a>. Gustavo recommends to take <em>estancias</em> into account. In the area, lonely planet recommends this one, 5 hours away from Chaltén. Perhaps too far away, but still thinkable for a day trip if it would be worthy.</li>
<li>Maybe get a local artisan to weight in for more variety in socio-economic diversity. People working on sidewalks are very common in Argentina. Would be good to notice if the cold of South Weather leaves them out or if the affluence of tourism gives opportunity for temporal jobs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="calafate-and-around">Calafate and around</h3>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Glaciar Perito Moreno. Boat. First item of the list, this is something that everyone that heads this way does, at any age. See the Glaciar, maybe have a whiskey on the rocks of the Glaciar, and back. The normal tour can be between an hour or up to 7.</li>
<li class="small"><a href="https://www.patagoniachic.com/descargas/catalogo-de-excursiones-2017-2018.pdf"> <mark>MarPatag</mark>: Experiencia Glaciares Gourmet</a>. This is a whole day visit to two Glaciars: Upsala (one of the biggest) and Spegazzini (highest). High social profile and Gourmet Cuisine. <strong>Contacted.</strong> Demands Payment to Reserve. I <a href="https://www.patagoniachic.com/patagonia-chic-excursiones-contacto.php">e-mailed </a>anyway by November 14th. </li>
<li>Glaciar Perito Moreno. Hiking on the Glaciar. This seems a must for anyone who can. Perhaps it may be overpriced, and not the real thing. But it is worth to know more about it. Perhaps it is somewhat alike to bush-walking through a pathway.</li>
<del><li>Balcones de Calafate. Promising sight-seeing, high and apart from the lake and main Glaciar.</li>
<li>Coqui Aristizábal. Music Studio Producer at Sala Siranush. I read about a discographic that makes albums on a musician's biography: Diego Frenkel who wrote <em>A través de las canciones</em> [ocassional co-artist with David Byrne]. The local producer should be available, a plus could be having the chance to interact with musicians. Why do they come all the way up to here? Does the environment help? Is this studio better than American ones, where they could also choose as equally valid (and frequent) options?</li></del>
<li> <mark>Elsa Rodríguez</mark>. Contact that my informant friend Gustavo Giorgis gave me. She should be a good link for other contacts. los horarios que tendría libres para hablar: 
		<ul>
			<li>De lunes a sabado > Al mediodía entre 14 y 15 hs</li>	
			<li> Los domingos > A la noche, después de las 23 ó 24 hs</li>
		</ul></li>
<li> <mark>Puerto Natale Internacional</mark>. Third world destiny related to trekking, as of Gustavo's recommendation.</li>
<li class="small"> <del>Dorte Beldal? Foreigner married to a local. Has a <a href="http://rasmussentravel.dk/about-us/">website</a>. wrote email 13 nov > Fully <strong>Booked</strong> 2019</del></li>
<li>Cerro Frías. This is not part of the Andes, hence it gives an important view of the rest. Also, the way through goes by a white oak forrest with local flora and fauna.</li>
<li>Safari Picture Tour / Estancia 25 de Mayo. Bird/Fauna watching: guanacos, condors, foxes; old marine fossils, first nations (-10000 years). Can be very unpromising (a cheap sell), but good to have a wide scope of what the local offer is.</li>
<del><li>Campo Municipal de Doma y Folklore. This place, as a state institution does not make much sense in being here down south, that is what makes it interesting, and likely out dated.</li>
<li>Centro de Interpretación Histórica [Archives]. This may come with some surprise from the origins of the discovery. Perhaps may serve as contrast with today. Also expectable to find visual material.</li></del>
<li>Glaciurium. Some of the above natural things + <em>Gift Shop</em>. To add a little more of the commercial aspect.</li>
<li class="small"><a href="http://www.glaciarsur.com/"> <mark>Glaciar Sur</mark> / Hike + Asado</a>. Asado/Barbeque: traditional and real regular national meal, perhaps because of culinar importance this item could be much higher in the list. <strong>Contacted</strong> November 14: wrote email.</li>
<del><li>Río Turbio, miner town, now in conflict. A great chance if possible to travel up to the place. 3 hour drive.</li></del>
</ol>
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>Pablo Cabas. Political scientist living some hours away a little South in Ushuaia. It is a 12 hour drive, or a flight away, in case that he may come over. Interesting profile for us because he works in media at state level, and has a good amount of experience and may contribute to the view of the fieldwork and methods. Old friend from university period that I haven't seen for some time, but who is very well disposed upon when contacted.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- <p>Patagonia is quite big. The following places should not be considered because of far distance. But they were mentioned as important places to consider Patagonia by key informant Gustavo and I think it is a good idea you know as much as possible about what I got told.</p> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>Tolhuin, Tierra del Fuego. Between Ushuaia &amp; Río Grande. Two new friends in Colonia. Far fetched. By car is 10 hours away from Calafate.</li> -->
<!-- <li>Puerto Almanza, Canal de Beagle. Far fetched. By car 11 hours away from Calafate.</li> -->
<!-- <li>Estancia la Anita, Chubut. Note: See movie <a href="http://www.cine.ar/play">Patagonia Rebelde</a>. Very far fetched. By car 18 hours away from Calafate.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- <p>If possible to help with trip these two people may be of value:</p> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li>Gustavo Giorgis. Long life experience. Direct Contact. My aunt's partner.</li> -->
<!-- <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1108266/">Ezequiel Acuña</a>. Film maker, friend of a friend. He lives in Buenos Aires and has a profile inclined more to artistic projects than commercial ones. This does not mean that he is a B player, but rather the type of director that does films that don't go to cinemas but do go to international festivals. Would be a blast if we could work with him. Perhaps now would be rather short notice, but hey, we are optimists.</li> -->
