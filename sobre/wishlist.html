<!-- <p>I received some insights from an Informant who is living in the same area as I do. He is outside of the area of fieldwork, but lived down there South many years working with hitchhikers: Gustavo Giorgis. He gave some recommendations and contacts for the area, both in or near Chalt√©n and Calafate. In total I completed a numbered list of 24 options but also added several other mentions that could also be considered.</p> -->

</li>
<p>Important notes about access to different daily trips. Mainly that we will have to plan how to carry the equipment because we will not be able to reach all destinations by car, we would need 4x4 truck or alike which can be provided by guides. In case that we go only by our car, then the distances to reach each place extend further than what would be reasonable to walk, some 24 kms (nearly 15 miles) total in some cases. Some options surrounding Mont Fitz Roy:</p>
<ol>
	<li><dt> <b>To Monte Fitz Roy, through Laguna de Los Tres</b> </dt>	
	<dd>17 kms by road. Then walk 12 kms towards destination (then come back 12 kms again). This path has a strong inclination so is expected to be hard. Also we can go back through another trail to capture different views. </dd></li>
	<li><dt> <b>Laguna Torre</b> </dt>	
	<dd>Also 12 kms to walk, and back. Less vertical demanding than previous. </dd></li>
	<li><dt> <b>Intermediate options</b> </dt>
	<dd>Only 4/6 kms for both previous destinations.</dd></li>
	<li><dt> <b>Out of town options: Reservas Los Huemules + Lago del Desierto </b> </dt>
	<dd>At 20K and 37K from town: very interesting and picturesque places to film. Nota bene: The roads here are made of gravel. </dd></li>
	<li><dt> <b>Price: 210 dollars a day for a group of our 4 persons.</b> </dt></li>
	<li> <dt> <b>My Comment</b> </dt>
	<dd>Perhaps best options because practical/viable are the Intermediate and One of the Out of town.</dd> </li>

Por otra parte, necesitan traslado de Calafate a Chalten?
Luego, para terminar de confirmar la reserva deben realizar el <mark>pago</mark>.
<p>Offer by the company as follows.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We can stay more time at the reservation. For instance, depart at morning in the boat that goes to the two Glaciars [Vespigniani + Viedma], arriving at 1020 am to the reservation and then that the boat picks us up at 0130 pm, which would give us nearly 3 hours in the place. This would have a net cost of 2250 Argentinean pesos per person.</li>
	<li>As for transport, we can go by private transport up to Lago del Desierto, or in a regular service (verbatim ¬ø?). The costs are 850 Argentinean pesos: going out at 8 am and coming back at 7/8 pm. Once back from the reservation we could still use nearly an hour at Lago del Desierto, so we can go up to Glaciar Huemul and stay there.</li>
	<li>Private transport is 1680 Argentinean pesos, going out at 8 am, and coming back when ready.</li>

<del><li><a href="https://www.estanciaelcondor.com/#4">Estancia el Condor</a>. Gustavo recommends to take <em>estancias</em> into account. In the area, lonely planet recommends this one, 5 hours away from Chalt√©n. Perhaps too far away, but still thinkable for a day trip if it would be worthy.</li>
</del>
<li>Maybe get a local artisan to weight in for more variety in socio-economic diversity. People working on sidewalks are very common in Argentina. Would be good to notice if the cold of South Weather leaves them out or if the affluence of tourism gives opportunity for temporal jobs. Perhaps consider <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/30281">Urban Hitchhiking</a>? Maybe too far fetched.</li>

Perhaps now would be rather short notice, but hey, we are optimists.</li> -->
