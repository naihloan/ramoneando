# Have you seen your city walls lately?
## The changing life of street art

### Walls unfoldings
Walls are, by definition, inert. Right? Wrong. That is, they seem to do nothing, but have many effects and allow social life to blossom. **Some people detest walls** because they remind them of the places they can't access. **Some other people like walls** because they're a tactical-technological mechanism that give shelter. Walls can be covers to create an interior: in doing so they also create barriers against the exterior. That's only logical: Animal life can be fierce. 

**Walls** in their mere materiality **make things happen**: they impede urban functions, and enable shifting vitality and/or numbness in city life. Walls also canalize spaces for movement. Their distribution allow, or impede, unnoticed flows to pass: such as sun, air, artificial light, cars, people, happynes and surprise.

(Walls do different stuff through many angles.) Walls are the sides of homeless' houses. Walls dialogue with those who choose or are pushed to find "arrons" in the street. Each wall does not have a single meaning. They  _speak_, so to speak, differently to everyone. Walls don't have a single tongue, and each wall is different one from another. 

But what is this nonsense, walls have meaning? This may be debatable, but they surely have effects. To be blind of these effects is to not understand how the place we live in is. And ultimately walls are build by specific persons, by specific ~orders demands goals reasons ends~ ideas, to maintain a certain order, both in the physical sense and metaphorically.

But that's not the whole picture. Other people don't even speak any _wall language_. That is, because walls remain invisible in their uses. And hence become naturalized, that is, assumed as natural, which they are not.

### Little do we know | The Major and Minor players of the game

We see walls differently than some centuries ago. In the past century, the XXth, graffiti writers (a label for a number of mixed subcultures) called our attention to walls. And most subcultures only get proper attention from broader society when they become institutionalized, that is, recognized as a proper and legitimate form of social gathering of some value beyond their mere micro cosmos. Some cultures and people are not even recognized before, during nor even after.

Now some see walls with the life of graffiti writers, painters, because of the heritage of the past half century. But what if we could have appreciated the social importance of graffiti and walls before indoctrinated to do so? 

The classic example of an ignored ~artist~ individual is Vincent Van Gogh dying poor and valued only as a personal weight to his brother and close acquaintances. Dylan, another growingly recognized artist, was called Judas for experimenting with elecrical sounds when guitars allowed for that exploration. And plenty artists ~and non artists as well~ walk the earth without no one (not even themselves yet) being able to look into the future knowing their _spiritual worth_. Some historians look back to recognize grand idols and their uprising. Anthropolgists look at the present to see how they form in situ. But what is ahead? At least a subtle attentive gaze could be in place. Maybe looking backwards can help to look forward.

Keeping track on how to first spott graffiti as a new youth urban culture: Two mayor players took pictures, when these were not massively taken, posed, edited, and shared. Early photographers for street art history were Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant. They made pictures for magazines, books, and movies (see the early _Style Wars_), and what not.

Let us not forget the several unknown and forgotten minor players: graffiti artists in the early days, and many other unnoticed peripheral social actors such as bombers, bathroom scribblers, and occasional love messengers. Of many urban presences no historic record will remain. Some may later become iconized as rock stars, and be a social (and market) reference for other growing writers. But the point is not about the latter success, but the fact that underdogs (~all "dogs"~ everyone) matter(s). No matter who, how many, or why. Just because. Walls can help to forget this point, or remember to look at the social life that surround them. 

#### Becoming popular | But missing the point

No one --or not many at least-- were looking at urban wall painters in the beginning, or today for the case. In the 70s Henry Chalfant documented in pictures the american hip-hop culture as it was coming to life for the first time. He stated that breakdancing and people painting on trains were on the spirit of [_competing to do something beautiful_](http://tinyurl.com/z3m95zz). 

This is how graffiti culture become glorified and placed as street art, in which one of the consequences was to make the city a prettier place. The tagged names and shapes of spray can signatures molded the forms of a somewhat abstract art: a new art form... "which is going to make a lot of ink run: graffiti". Granted. Graffiti is many times equaled to art. Samo --street name of the more widely known artist by his complete name: Jean-Michel Basquiat-- has entered in the top most valuable painters to have a picture sold for above the line of the 100 M. But market and art is just but a very small fraction of the picture. 

Claiming art for urban interventions is just a glorification of one possible aspect, not always the most valuable. Given that this is true in some amount, hatred against rules and commodified spaces has it's place as well. Not all is fun and games. Abandoned places are also sites for rape, murder, assault, as well as the playground of the forgotten ones. Be it for better or worse, society flourishes among city walls. Graffiti advocates even say that colors on a wall is not the problem but the context. Chalfant goes on that direction.

> Everybody says "oh graffiti: big crime, vandalism" and everything. But the fact is, from the point of view of you know from the big picture the biggest crime was the abandonment of neighbourhoods by both the federal government and the local government. **I have no patience with people who really complain and complain bitterly about graffiti as such of a big problem.** 

## Graffiti consideration list
- Beware of the search for beauty. That is a very outdated artistic concept. Today art isn't about beauty, or at least not about that alone. Fireworks can be just for magic tricks. The streets aren't about pretty places alone either. There's much more to the picture than that. And it's well worth attending to. There are people too.
- Consider experimentation as a value to ponder walls and streets. Hendrix did so with an electrical guitar and went a very long way. 
- The painted wall is where you are at, as well as that of the painter. "Hi neighbour", or a slight nod, once in a while is not pushing sociality to far away for a sane citizen life. Hence the following,
- Some homeless don't even have a temporary roof, so a near-by wall can be the presence of close social companionship. "Kilroy was here" can be the reflex of a past presence. And it's in some strange way, company.
- Discover elements beyond paint, wall, graffiti-doers and go beyond the few elements of this list. Imagine.
- City scribbling and scratching ~shows the flow of city self-consciousness. It~ is not supposed to be properly and harmonically composed. Ideas and city paintings change, get ~crossed~ striked out, covered by gray painting forming layers over layers. That's why straight lines and curly cross overs, even when pushing for space against each other, live together in the same space. 
- Strike throughs beyond walls: ~in paper~ in digital media have a place as well. It's all in the on going process. ~Live with it. Actually, sorry, I can't tell you what to do.~

## Surrender and dive into the streets

The problem is not that we don't grasp the huge social challenge around walls. It's that we're just not that interested. We, not the walls, are somewhat inert. Not that there's anything wrong with you, me or some wrongdoer people, quite the contrary: it's only that no one can grasp all that a wall relates to and entails. The world is vast, intricate and infinite in unfoldings. Shall we join an exploration.

> _Buenos Aires is a complex, chaotic city. It has European style and a Latin American heart. It has oscillated between dictatorship and democracy for over a century, and its citizens have barely known political or economic stability. Throughout Buenos Aires' turbulent history, successive generations of activists and artists have taken to the streets to express themselves, through words and through art. This has given the walls a powerful and symbolic role. They have become the city's voice. This powerful tradition of expression in public space; of art and activism, has made the streets of Buenos Aires into a riot of colour and communication._
# Walls with people
Walls don't actually have people inside them, they're just on the other side. **You just don't get it. You simply don't understand walls** ~You don't get it but it's not such a big deal.~
