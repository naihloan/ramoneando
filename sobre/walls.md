# Have you seen your city walls lately?
## The changing life of street art

### Walls unfoldings
Walls are, by definition, inert. Right? Wrong. That is, they seem to do nothing, but have many effects and allow social life to blossom. **Some people detest walls** because they remind them of the places they can't access. **Some other people like walls** because they're a tactical-technological mechanism that give shelter. Walls can be covers to create an interior: in doing so they also create barriers against the exterior. That's only logical: Animal life can be fierce. 

**Walls** in their mere materiality **make things happen**: they impede urban functions, and enable shifting vitality and/or numbness in city life. Walls also canalize spaces for movement. Their distribution allow, or impede, unnoticed flows to pass: such as sun, air, artificial light, cars, people, happynes and surprise.

(Walls do different stuff through many angles.) Walls are the sides of homeless' houses. Walls dialogue with those who choose or are pushed to find "arrons" in the street. Each wall does not have a single meaning. They  _speak_, so to speak, differently to everyone. Walls don't have a single tongue, and each wall is different one from another. 

But what is this nonsense, walls have meaning? This may be debatable, but they surely have effects. To be blind of these effects is to not understand how the place we live in is. And ultimately walls are build by specific persons, by specific ~orders demands goals reasons ends~ ideas, to maintain a certain order, both in the physical sense and metaphorically.

But that's not the whole picture. Other people don't even speak any _wall language_. That is, because walls remain invisible in their uses. And hence become naturalized, that is, assumed as natural, which they are not.

### Little do we know | The Major and Minor players of the game

We see walls differently than some centuries ago. In the past century, the XXth, graffiti writers (a label for a number of mixed subcultures) called our attention to walls. And most subcultures only get proper attention from broader society when they become institutionalized, that is, recognized as a proper and legitimate form of social gathering of some value beyond their mere micro cosmos. Some cultures and people are not even recognized before, during nor even after.

Now some see walls with the life of graffiti writers, painters, because of the heritage of the past half century. But what if we could have appreciated the social importance of graffiti and walls before indoctrinated to do so? 

The classic example of an ignored ~artist~ individual is Van Gogh dying poor and valued only as a personal weight to his brother and close acquaintances. Dylan, another growingly recognized artist, was called Judas for experimenting with elecrical sounds when guitars allowed for that exploration. And plenty artists ~and non artists as well~ walk the earth without no one (not even themselves yet) being able to look into the future knowing their _spiritual worth_. Some historians look back to recognize grand idols and their uprising. Anthropolgists look at the present to see how they form in situ. But what is ahead? At least a subtle attentive gaze could be in place. Maybe looking backwards can help to look forward.

Keeping track on how to first spott graffiti as a new youth urban culture: Two mayor players took pictures, when these were not massively taken, posed, edited, and shared. Early photographers for street art history were Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant. They made pictures for magazines, books, and movies (see the early _Style Wars_), and what not.

And let us not forget the minor players, graffiti artists in the early days. Some may later become rock stars, and be a social (and market) reference for other growing writers. But what the point is not about the latter success, but the fact that underdogs (~all "dogs"~ everyone) matter(s). No matter who, how many, or why.

#### Becoming popular

Henry Chalfant documented in pictures the american hip-hop culture of the 70s. He stated that breakdancing and people painting on trains were on the spirit of [_competing to do something beautiful_](http://tinyurl.com/z3m95zz). This is how graffiti culture become glorified and placed as street art, in which one of the consequences was to make the city a prettier place. The tagged names and shapes of spray can signatures molded the forms of a somewhat abstract art: a new art form... "which is going to make a lot of ink run: graffiti". 

Granted. Graffiti is many times equaled to art. But that's just one small part of the picture. Claiming art for urban interventions is just a glorification of one possible aspect, not always the most valuable. Given that this is true in some amount, hatred against rules and commodified spaces has it's place as well. 

# Painted walls say plenty | Walls alone do much alone in fact as well

[White walls say nothing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3254710/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl)

> _Buenos Aires is a complex, chaotic city. It has European style and a Latin American heart. It has oscillated between dictatorship and democracy for over a century, and its citizens have barely known political or economic stability. Throughout Buenos Aires' turbulent history, successive generations of activists and artists have taken to the streets to express themselves, through words and through art. This has given the walls a powerful and symbolic role. They have become the city's voice. This powerful tradition of expression in public space; of art and activism, has made the streets of Buenos Aires into a riot of colour and communication._

# Walls with people

Walls don't actually have people inside them, they're just on the other side. 

## Surrender and dive into the streets
#### On the inscriptions (and other artifacts) of the walls

**You just don't get it. You simply don't understand walls** 

You don't get it but it's not such a big deal.
Not that there's anything wrong with you, quite the contrary: 
it's only that no one can grasp all that a wall entails.

nd graffiti defensors even say that colors on a wall is not the problem but the context.
Chalfant goes on that direction.

> Everybody says "oh graffiti: big crime, vandalism" and everything. But the fact is, from the point of view of you know from the big picture the biggest crime was the abandonment of neighbourhoods by both the federal government and the local government. **I have no patience with people who really complain and complain bitterly about graffiti as such of a big problem.**

The problem is not that we don't understand. It's that we're just not that interested.
