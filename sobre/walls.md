# Painted walls say plenty | Walls alone do much alone in fact as well

> _Buenos Aires is a complex, chaotic city. It has European style and a Latin American heart. It has oscillated between dictatorship and democracy for over a century, and its citizens have barely known political or economic stability. Throughout Buenos Aires' turbulent history, successive generations of activists and artists have taken to the streets to express themselves, through words and through art. This has given the walls a powerful and symbolic role. They have become the city's voice. This powerful tradition of expression in public space; of art and activism, has made the streets of Buenos Aires into a riot of colour and communication._

# Walls with people

Walls don't actually have people inside them, they're just on the other side. 



## Surrender and dive into the streets
#### On the inscriptions (and other artifacts) of the walls

**You just don't get it. You simply don't understand walls** 

You don't get it but it's not such a big deal.
Not that there's anything wrong with you, quite the contrary: 
it's only that no one can grasp all that a wall entails.

#### Walls unfoldings

Walls can be covers to create an interior: but are also barriers against the exterior.

**Some people detest walls** because they remind them of the places they can't access. 
**Some other people like walls** because they're a tactical-technological mechanism that gives shelter. 
That's only logical (animal life can be fierce). 

**Walls** in their mere materiality **make things**, 
impede urban functions, and enable shifting vitality and/or numbness in city life.
Walls stand tall in urban architecture, but also canalize spaces for movement. 
They allow unnoticed flows to pass: 
such as sun, air, artificial light, cars, people, happynes and surprise.

(Walls do different stuff through many angles.)  
Walls are the sides of homeless' houses.
Walls dialogue with those who choose or are pushed to find "arrons" in the street.

Each wall does not have a single meaning. 
It _speaks_, so to speak, differently to everyone.
Walls don't have a single tongue, and each wall is different one from another. 

But what is this nonsense, walls have meaning? 
This may be debatable, but they surely have effects.
To be blind of these effects is to not understand how the place we live in is.
And ultimately walls, are build by specific persons, by specific orders, to maintain a certain order, both in the physical sense and others.

But that's not the whole picture.
Others don't even speak any _wall language_. 
That is, because walls remain invisible in their uses. 
And hence become naturalized, that is, assumed as natural, which they are not.

#### The Major and Minor players of the game

Most art is accepted when institutionalized (not before and sometimes not even after).
The classic example is Van Gogh dying poor and not valued.
Dylan was called Judas for experimenting.
And artists walk the earth without no one yet being able to look into the future knowing their _spiritual worth_.
Some historians look back to recognize grand idols and their uprising.
Anthropolgists look at the present to see how they form in situ.
But what is ahead?

Let's at least keep track of the people that first spotted graffiti as a new youth urban culture.
Two mayor players took pictures, when these were not massively taken, posed, edited, and shared.
Early photographers for street art history were Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant.
They made pictures for magazines, books, and movies (see the early _Style Wars_), and what not.

But don't forget the minor players, graffiti artists. They'd later become rock stars.
But what the point is not about the latter success, but the fact that underdogs matter. 
No matter who or why.

#### "Competing to do something beautiful"

Henry Chalfant once documented in pictures the american hip-hop culture of the 70s. He stated that breakdancing and people painting on trains were on the spirit of [_competing to do something beautiful_](http://tinyurl.com/z3m95zz). This is how graffiti culture become glorified and placed as street art, in which one of the consequences was to make the city a prettier place. The tagged names and shapes of spray can signatures molded the forms of a somewhat abstract art: a new art form... "which is going to make a lot of ink run: graffiti". 

Granted. Graffiti is many times equaled to art. But that's just one small part of the picture. 
Claiming art for urban interventions is just a glorification of one possible aspect, not always the most valuable.
Given that this is true in some amount, hatred against rules and commodified spaces has it's place as well.
And graffiti defensors even say that colors on a wall is not the problem but the context.
Chalfant goes on that direction.

> Everybody says "oh graffiti: big crime, vandalism" and everything. But the fact is, from the point of view of you know from the big picture the biggest crime was the abandonment of neighbourhoods by both the federal government and the local government. **I have no patience with people who really complain and complain bitterly about graffiti as such of a big problem.**
