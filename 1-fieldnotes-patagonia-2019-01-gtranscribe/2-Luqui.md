## Luqui Bernacchi @ Glaciarium / Calafate [2019 01]

00:39 Phil: Could you tell me who you are, where we are and where we're about to go?  

01:08 LUQUI: My name is Luciano Bernacchi, I am one of the directors in Glaciarium, which is a Glaciar Museum. Me are in Southern Patagonia, Argentina. Overlooking Argentino Lake, and we are near the National Park here, where the most famous Glaciar is, the world known is called Glaciar Perito Moreno. 

01:39 Phil: One of the key words of this project is this [...] So I will anticipate towards the end that I will ask whether the glaciers are wilderness in your opinion.  

LUQUI: Well, it's part of it. [...]  

02:14 Phil: The first question is [...] if you could [...] tell me the reason for the glaciar being under UNESCO's World Heritage List. So, what is the outstanding universal value of the glaciers?  

02:58 Why was it inscribed, and if you can remember when it was.

03:02 LUQUI: I can check that, I don't remember. '81 I think. Phil: Yes!

LUQUI: So, Parque Nacional Los Glaciares [Los Glaciares National Park], one of the largest in Argentina, was declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981, and it has that category, that status ever since, and they are few in Argentina, and the main reason being the importance and  

03:29 the vastness of the networks of glaciers that are protected, together with their wilderness, forests, estepas and the whole habitat.

03:48 Phil: Another thing that I want to ask to you is if you could describe your research, your work a bit more precisely, the kind of things you're involved with right now?

04:07 LUQUI: Glaciology in Argentina is something that is still beginning. Let's say there are few people truly dedicated, you have to chance of  chatting with our scientific director, Pedro Svarka, one of the most renown glaciologists in South America, and he has been working in the area in Southern Patagonia and in Antarctica for over 40 years. 

04:27 When we decided to build Glaciarium it was fundamental to have somebody of his caliber to help us with all his scientific knowledge and rigor. So basically the whole point of Glaciarium is to bring to the general public the latest and most accurate information so they can understand the importance and how glaciers work on a global scale but of course with more detail of Patagonia.  

04:57 And then something about what is happening now ... OK. So the Glaciares National Park is part of the Southern Patagonia Ice Field which is shared between Argentina and Chile, and a lot of the research is of the dynamics of the glaciers has been done specially starting to the '90s and scientists from different parts of the world: Austria, Japan, US, Canada, Argentina, and a few others, Swiss also, came here and worked in collaboration  

05:29 to first of all what you need to do to study glaciers is determine its behavior, its status, and whether it is growing or whether it is receding. Most of them of course, just like everywhere else in the world, are receding. These classes are called outlet glaciers and as they bring ice from the core of the ice field need to lower elevations and they carve either into the ocean when they go to the Chilean side or into big glaciers which we have on this side.  

05:59 So there are studies that research on the velocity, how much they move, and most important what is called the mass balance, which is basically comparing how much ice is forming one year, and how much ice is lost during that same time, in order to establish its behavior. Either it is growing or receding. Or stable. And we do have a few stable glaciers in the area, which is rather unusual but the vast majority are receding very fast, very quickly.  

06:25 Phil: So, you have been using the word behavior and as a social scientist it is a fun word to use. But, it's almost a perfect coincidence that the panel behind you in the very first sentence, which is my favorite sentence in the entire Glaciarium, "The Glaciar seems to be alive". Can you give me your thoughts on how  

06:53 the glaciar can seem to be alive?

06:57 LUQUI: Glaciers are very active and every change in systems, in nature, just like others, but the glaciers is something that at first site looks sort of like massive, almost insurmountable, because it is so big, and you think it is always there. But nothing is perpetual, they are actually changing all the time. And nowadays with the problems of climate change and global changes that are happening in our planet, glaciers have been used as  

07:27 the cannon in the coal mine, because they show very subtle changes, they react very quickly, so they crack, they melt, there is a lot going on and specially on those glaciers that we have in the area that carve into the water, there's going to be activity and movement all the time. In most cases you can't see, but in these cases any person coming and sitting or standing by the face of the glacier for a half in hour so  

07:54 it's likely to see this movement. That's why we say glaciers seem to be alive, because they're changing and they're moving and there's always something going on with them.  

08:04 Phil: That's fascinating. Thank you for that. There is a ... This is not a question, it's more like a comment. There's research done in the Yukon with indigenous populations who share with anthropologists in particular, and recall the stories of how the glaciers, who say that they hear the glaciers, that they glaciers listen to us.  

08:30 LUQUI: Ah, that's interesting.  

08:32 Phil: One of the many ways, this is a colleague of mine who has done this work: indigenous populations find that we must be respectful to the glaciers, that there are certain things that we must not do, me must not be loud. We must not cook with grease, near the glaciers. All the same ... And the glaciers respond through weather.

09:03 LUQUI: That's interesting. That's something that we like here because there is no, I mean, the few indigenous groups of Patagonia never lived anywhere near the glaciers. I mean, near but there's no connection like you would find with any Inuit or Thule or anyone from the Northern Hemisphere. People in Greenland, even in Norway, of course the Alps, and most important in Alaska. And Canada.  

09:28 These people were living very near in close relation with glaciers. Although in Patagonia we have a lot of ice, glaciology, the study of glaciers or even people venturing into the glaciers started only when mountaineers and explorers arrived in Patagonia 100 years ago. Not before that.  

09:48 Phil: Are there any science whatsoever, archaeological science of human presence even temporary in the glaciers?

09:56 LUQUI: No. There is human inhabitation in Patagonia for 10,000 years in this area but all of it is more to the East and basically these people were hunters and gatherers that were chasing guanacos, chasing rheas, which is like an ostrich type of bird. And there was no reason for them to get close to the glaciers.

10:19 It was cold, harsh, inhospitable. They didn't have anything to eat there. So, you don't see any mention in the cosmography or rituals, or paintings or anything.

Phil: Thank you for sharing that. Here is another panel on icebergs. It is important to me and my research.  

10:50 Phil: So I want to ask you a question about this. The language here is really unique. Sailing amongst icebergs is like navigating through sculptures, gorgeous statues. Now, we have... UNESCO has a list of cultural heritage sites and a list of natural heritage sites. Cultural Heritage is typically full of sculptures and gorgeous statues and paintings, and things of that sort.  

11:26 Phil: The natural list is full of natural things. So here we have something that is pushing us to rethink that so I am kind of wondering what your thoughts are on the language here. Are icebergs statues?

11:41 LUQUI: Icebergs are an essential part of the aftermath of glaciers, when they are arrive into the sea or lake they calve, they break off, and that's how icebergs are born. And of course there are huge, they are of various shapes and they have been referred to in literature and history, of anyone exploring, specially the polar regions, the Arctic and Antarctica, down here in Patagonia we have icebergs in the lakes, and  

12:10 they are truly nature's works of art. Because all of them are unique and none of them are the same and even if men wanted to recreate an iceberg they would never do such a good job as the natural thing.  

12:27 Phil: Thank you for sharing that.

12:38 Benji: The opposite side would be that as well as this side is what Pedro talked about, that he doesn't feel comfortable with the poetic side, is ...

12:54 LUQUI: It was just a challenge to, I mean, after all we are happy with what we have. The only thing is that the guy who did it, we had to police him all the time. Otherwise it would have been full of poetry and little fact. Now, on the other hand, if whoever it is, Pedro or a scientist would be to provide some information it would have been boring. And that's the truth. So I think we have a good balance and my job was actually to act as that liaison between the science and the guys who built it.  

13:24 So, it's good. Most people find it enjoyable.  

Benji: You're satisfied with the end result.

LUQUI: Yeah, yeah. It was hard to ... It was always something that becomes with a little more of this, less of the other... This one [panel] is the one with the Inuits. No, where were we? I don't remember what you were asking about this.  

13:50 Phil: How much time do you spend on any of this?

13:51 LUQUI: Oh well. Many years, because I worked as a mountain guide, and helping research and I am always around ice. I spend 5 months in the year now in the Arctic or in Antarctica. And the rest of the time I live here. So, [laughter] have an hour away from the ice.  

14:06 Phil: So, here's a question that is ...

14:10 LUQUI: I've seen glaciers all over the world, everywhere.  

Phil: You know  about you, not so much as a scientist even if you can separate that...

14:18 LUQUI: I am not a scientist! Eh? I'm active more as a film support for scientists. I've never intended to undertake research myself.  

Phil: So my question is this. How do you feel emotionally, personally when you are in the glacier. If you could just imagine someone who has never been anywhere near a glacier and you've spent a lot of time

14:43 on them, perhaps you have been in them: what's it like to be on a glacier?

14:50 LUQUI: I think it's a very good reminder of how small we are as humans, as mankind, and it's you know when you're walking on a glacier, specially the large ones, you can walk for days of course, get into the middle of the ice to guide expeditions across the ice fields for two-three weeks, and it's a true contact with the harsh, unforgiving, sort of wilderness. Like somebody going and climbing a mountain,  

15:17 somebody sailing a little sail boat across an ocean. It's that type of feeling that different people get in different ways. That sense of solitude, remoteness, you have to be self sufficient. So basically you're not in charge and you're just transiting this icy world, let's say.

[...]

15:45 Phil: Do you have a favorite one?  

15:49 LUQUI: A favorite glacier? Well, probably this one here, simply because it's like my glacier. I've lived here for 25 years. So ...

Phil: So tell us about it. This one right here ...

LUQUI: I mean Perito Moreno. I mean like half an hour away. No, that's just a graph about temperatures.

Phil: Why is Perito Moreno your favorite over ... ?

16:09 LUQUI: I've seen many glaciers all over the world and Perito Moreno is, because I'm used to live here, 45 minutes away a Calafate drive and you arrive to the glacier. It's beautiful aesthetically. It's surrounded by green Forrest, which is quite unusual. In other parts of the world they have glaciers in Polar Regions, high latitudes, don't have many trees, or you have them high above the mountain where it is above the tree line. In few places you have green and ice together.

16:35 Also it's stable. It hasn't been receding, so it's pretty much alive and here I am. And the [cherry] icing on the cake let's say is this rupture that it produces every couple of years. It's a great arch that collapses, with a lot of water crashing through and it's an amazing show! So, yeah.

16:57 Phil: So let's switch gear and talk about challenges, particularly with regards to conservation. What is the most significant challenge with regards to conservation that the glaciers are facing at the moment?

17:16 LUQUI: So glaciers, like many other features of our natural world, are facing challenges in conservation. But unlike let's say wildlife or forest, where you can protect it locally, and you may be successful, you can't do anything locally to help a glacier. Yeah, of course, no littering and stuff like that. But glaciers are susceptible to change in terms of climate change and global change, so whatever ...

17:44 even if you're in South National Park, if temperatures rising or there is less snow, or things change in the atmosphere, that's going to affect the glaciers. So to protect glaciers you really have to think globally. And it's a big challenge.  

18:05 Phil: I've learned that... Sorry for going back and forth, I just need different angles to cut. I've learned when we went on the MarPatag cruise that there are still cows, feral cows.

LUQUI: Yeah, they're trying to remove them but yeah. That doesn't affect the ice but of course the forest.  

Phil: However, because we were very distant from the guide when she was talking about that, we didn't really capture the full story. Do you know much about that? What is the situation about?

18:36 LUQUI: Yeah yeah. So, the National Park Los Glaciares protects the glaciers but, as I mentioned before, it has a beautiful Southern beach forest, or antarctic forest as it's called. Which is our native forest in Patagonia and some areas of the Park suddenly have had the feral cows because they run wild for the last almost 60/70 years.

19:03 In the past, before the Park was created in 1937 they were neighboring estancias, where they had cows, and like everywhere in Argentina and some of them just ventured into these remote areas and they stayed there long after the Park was created. And it's very hard: geography, hard to reach places, so obviously cows began adapting to this mountain environment and they've been there ever since.  

19:28 The last years the National Park is doing a big job in trying to remove them because feral cows, in particular here, they start eating young trees, they start scratching against the bark of the trees and the bark comes off and fungi come in the trees. In winter, when there's snow they start roaming even more so they are a big problem for the vegetation, the undergrowth and also for erosion, because our soils here are very very fragile.  

20:00 So it's [not a very?] good idea to introduce animals here and there and the cows have a bit of a problem here. Luckily they're not all over the Park and still the numbers are, lets say, they can be controlled or cowed, or removed... If they keep working on it.  

Phil: Do you think in general, I mean in this case it seems the National Park has been very active...  

LUQUI: Well, not really [laughter]. They just started a couple of years ago. We've been asking why they don't shoot the bloody cows for the last [ten-thirty?] years.

20:30 Phil: In general do you think that National Park is doing a fair job in conservation, with regards to the glaciers?

20:37 LUQUI: Yeah, yeah. The National Park is quite stable and it's a solid institution within Argentina. And it's actually one of the largest National Parks system in the world in terms of amount of more than 40 big National Parks. The 3rd National Park in the world was created here, after Yellowstone, and the second one I don't remember.  

21:00 So, we're very happy with it. Of course, sometimes like many other things in Argentina, the lack of funds and appropriate gear or man power will affect so we always want things to work better, and we have to hope for that but they do a great job.  

Phil: Sorry, did you say this was what number?

LUQUI: #3\. Not this one eh. The Argentinean system and the first one in Argentina was in Bariloche, which is Northern Patagonia.  

21:27 So that's called Nahuel Huapi. That was the 2nd of the National Parks in the World. Yellowstone came 1st ...

Phil: X came 2nd in New Zealand I think.  

LUQUI: We're talking about 1890 something. Yeah, it's over there.  

Phil: A challenge for Wikipedia. That's great thank you.  

21:46 LUQUI: What about Canada, when was it's 1st National Park?

Phil: It was 4th in the world. [...] A question on wilderness. First of all I am going to ask you if you believe that Los Glaciares National Park is a wilderness.  

22:22 LUQUI: Yeah, yeah. Of course. So Los Glaciares National Park is a true vast almost unspoiled because they're some challenges. Wilderness and few places in the world can rely on the chance of walking, mountaineering, traversing glaciers for days and days and weeks. And stay in remote areas.  

22:46 Certainly that cannot happen in Europe. In a few places in South America, of course. And you have Canada, has huge mountain areas. But so it's very really valuable and in very conditions in terms of conservation.  

Phil: So you almost unspoiled...

23:06 LUQUI: Well because we mentioned the cows before.

Phil: Are there any other ways in which, sticking to the glaciers, they are impacted by people around them.  

LUQUI: No no. They're few people venturing into the glaciers. They're some commercial walks that operate everyday in Calafate on Perito Moreno, but that has no impact on the ice at all. And then anywhere else in the Park, 99,5 % of the surface of the Park is hardly visited at all.  

23:35 You do have the old bandoneer or explorer. It's really hard core hiking, trekking expeditions and it is not just a little walk. To venture inside the Park away from the tourist areas you need to be proper full trained mountaineer, self-sufficient. There are no mountain huts. Inside there's no rescue service. So, I say, there's a reason El Chaltén area, which is Mount Fitz Roy, which is also part of the same Park, is a bit of a mecca for mountaineers from all over the world.  

24:05 Because they have to find conditions that might be compatible to give an idea for Canadians of what you can find in Banff Island or places like that. Truly remote and harsh and demanding.

Benji: You spoke of the time you've been doing your work abroad in different places remotely, do you get a situation in which you're outside of your work environment and  

24:37 just because of your leisure time you find yourself exploring in this harsh way that you mentioned?

LUQUI: Yeah. I mean my work and my free time sometimes blend in together as I enjoy being in the outdoors, I've worked in the skiing business, I've worked in the mountaineering business, and I've always had a relation with mountains and glaciers, so, I love visiting these places.  

25:03 Phil: Last question. We asked Pedro, there's a panel ... There are many different glaciers in the Park, if you could point out which ones, what they're called.  

LUQUI: Would you like to do that in the ... Because the model is there, Patagonia Model. [...]

26:07 Phil: And briefly explain which ones are visited most often, and the all important question about the size. Everybody kind of ... It's a factual piece of information.

LUQUI: Los Glaciares National Park has a few hundred glaciers, all protected. Most of them are part of this huge network called the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. We're in a room where we have a lot of explanations, models about this. And,  

26:32 these glaciers, some of them, the big ones arrive into lakes. Lake Argentino and Lake Viedma, two monster sized lakes that are on the East of the Andes, and they receive all this ice. These glaciers are called outlet glaciers that flow into this lakes. From El Calafate which is the hub for visiting the area, people can go to the Northern area of the Park. There's a village called El Chaltén, where Mount Fitz Roy is.  

27:00 For hiking, mountaineering. And the main glacier that the people visit there is called Viedma. Viedma is actually the largest in the National Park and the second largest in South America after the Pío XI which is on the Chilean side. Close to Calafate there are both trips, there are walks to do, and the most visited glacier is the Perito Moreno, which is still pretty big: 257 km2\. And also people can visit

27:30 Glacier Upsala, which is quite large, the 2nd largest after Viedma, and Glacier Spegazzini, which is not about the same as Perito Moreno, a little bit smaller. All the glaciers I mentioned calve into the water and in most cases they're easy to visit on all the nice excursions or in some cases people can go on their own. Such as the ones in Chaltén or Perito Moreno there's a road and all the infrastructure to visit these magnificent glaciers.
