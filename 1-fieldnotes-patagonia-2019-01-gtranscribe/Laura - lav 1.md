**Interviewer:** [00:00:50.8] Well, this is the map from the area. We are here in Chaltén. We are next to part of this National Park, which is Los Glaciares National Park. As you see there are different trails, starting from town. The idea for today is to go to Torre Viewpoint, on Torre Trail. The Trail starts from here, from the town, so we start walking. 
 [00:01:20.5] And it's going to be about 2.5 kilometres to reach the viewpoint. On the way we have different viewpoints and today is a very clear and nice day so we will see Fitz Roy range and Torre range. It normally takes about 1.5 hours to reach this point and then we can return through the same path. Well, there are other options. 
 [00:01:49.4] Or some other short hikes, like Condor's and Eagles. I don't know if you researched about the hikes and options. If I should I explain to you ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:02:02.5] No. That's good. That's perfect! Sounds great! Good to go. 
 [00:02:33.3] [Small talk. Money, pipa climbing, mic, walking direction.]
 [00:06:36.3] [Small talk. Places and people we've seen. Laura is also from Córdoba.]
**Interviewer:** [00:08:53.9] How long have you been here?
**Laura:** [00:09:05.6] Fourteen years. I came for the first time because I was studying tourism in Córdoba, and I came with my family on holidays. We knew the owner of a lodge, El Pilar, on the way to Lago del Desierto. So I spoke with them and they said it was OK. There's a lot of work here in summer. 
 [00:09:35.4] So you should come. And I came the next year alone. And I fell in love with the place again. And then I met my boyfriend, my husband here. And well, every winter we go on holidays somewhere but now we can say that we live here. First years were just a few months here. And then Córdoba, and other places but now we go maybe for one month or two months for vacations. And then we return. 
**Interviewer:** [00:10:09.0] You said that you studied tourism? 
**Laura:** [00:10:13.8] Yes. 
**Interviewer:** [00:10:17.8] Maybe you know about other people, with other jobs, do you know NGOs over here or in Calafate? Like conservationists ... 
**Laura:** [00:10:30.3] Yes. There's an organization here in Chaltén. It's called ... Well, it's a big one, but some members are here. It's called "Ambiente Sur" [South Environment]. And they worked in this place for two areas, that are protected. One is here, there's a lagoon there. And the other one is the shore over the river. To protect those areas. 
 [00:11:02.5] This is the Andian Club. There's an indoor wall. 
 [00:11:37.3] [Small talk to contact them.]
**Interviewer:**  [00:12:13.2] Are Calafate and Chaltén different from each other? 
**Laura:** [00:12:16.7] Very different, yeah!! Both places are ... Well, the same main activities, in tourism. But Chaltén is much smaller and more oriented in mountain trekking and Calafate [x] a lot in the last years, because it's in a very open area, and it's not like Chaltén that's surrounded by the National Park. 
 [00:12:44.2] So that's like the limit of the town. In Calafate, well, the expansion was huge. Actually nowadays there are close to 40,000 inhabitants in Calafate. It's very big. And well, the main attraction is the National Park but there are more options for those who don't want to walk. In Chaltén it's mainly trekking. Not many options by car or in town. 
**Interviewer:** [00:13:17.1] So a different type of visitor.
**Laura:** [00:13:19.1] Yes! Normally people go to both but there's a lot of people that go just to Calafate and don't come to Chaltén. Or some people come just for the day, to Chaltén, by bus. 
**Interviewer:** [00:13:36.5] They come to climb Mount Fitz Roy and then they go back. 
**Laura:** [00:13:39.9] [Laughters.]
**Interviewer:** [00:13:54.7] 40,000 people you said.
**Laura:** [00:13:54.7] Yes! I heard that number a few days ago and I couldn't believe it. 
**Interviewer:** [00:14:01.7] And that's throughout the year, even in winter? 
**Laura:** [00:14:03.7] Yeah. Calafate became a bigger city so, well, it's not so limited as Chaltén, with the activities that in winter it's not impossible but it's not the same to try to do a hike, or climbing in winter. The activities in Calafate, even in the Perito Moreno Glaciar it's running almost all year around. 
 [00:14:32.5] They close just one month I think and there's tourism in low season of course, but there's tourism all year around. Chaltén is changing in the last years, and more places are still open in winter. But most of the restaurants, hotels, cabins, are closed in winter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:14:56.2] So you live here in the winter? 
**Laura:** [00:14:59.0] Yes. I have a daughter, two year old. So, well, in the last years we are staying more here, and just travelling in winter just to visit family and in vacations. But we don't work much in winter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:15:20.6] Does it get very cold in the winter? 
**Laura:** [00:15:23.6] It's cold but it's not extremely cold. Some days could be like 10-15 degrees below zero, but only a few days. And we can get snow in town but in the last winters just for a few days. Actually there's
 [00:15:45.2] a very small ski lift, for people in town, next to the town. And this year they couldn't put it because there wasn't enough snow, in the mountains. But here in town ...
**Interviewer:** [00:16:04.5] And is the wind better in winter?
**Laura:** [00:16:07.7] Well the theory is that in winter there's less wind but you can still get very strong winds. But normally it's in summer that we get more wind because there's something about the pressure, the ocean, the high pressure centres, between the ocean and the coast, in summer there's more difference so this is more attraction for the winds. And in winter it's more stable. But we had strong winds in the last winters. 
 [00:16:38.1] But it's nice, it's very calm. Very relaxed. The days are shorter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:16:44.8] Yeah, we've been lucky for the last three days. The first day that we arrived the wind was so strong. It was difficult just to walk. 
**Laura:** [00:16:59.0] Yes. We've had very windy days in the last week. 
**Interviewer:** [00:17:06.0] Someone told us that during very windy days a kayak showed up in their front. It just came from somewhere.
