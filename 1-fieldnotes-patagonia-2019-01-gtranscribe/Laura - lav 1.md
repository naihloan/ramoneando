Start \[00:00:50.8\] 
End \[01:51:44.5\]

**Interviewer:** [00:00:50.8] Well, this is the map from the area. We are here in Chaltén. We are next to part of this National Park, which is Los Glaciares National Park. As you see there are different trails, starting from town. The idea for today is to go to Torre Viewpoint, on Torre Trail. The Trail starts from here, from the town, so we start walking. 
 [00:01:20.5] And it's going to be about 2.5 kilometres to reach the viewpoint. On the way we have different viewpoints and today is a very clear and nice day so we will see Fitz Roy range and Torre range. It normally takes about 1.5 hours to reach this point and then we can return through the same path. Well, there are other options. 
 [00:01:49.4] Or some other short hikes, like Condor's and Eagles. I don't know if you researched about the hikes and options. If I should I explain to you ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:02:02.5] No. That's good. That's perfect! Sounds great! Good to go. 
 [00:02:33.3] [Small talk. Money, pipa climbing, mic, walking direction.]
 [00:06:36.3] [Small talk. Places and people we've seen. Laura is also from Córdoba.]
**Interviewer:** [00:08:53.9] How long have you been here?
**Laura:** [00:09:05.6] Fourteen years. I came for the first time because I was studying tourism in Córdoba, and I came with my family on holidays. We knew the owner of a lodge, El Pilar, on the way to Lago del Desierto. So I spoke with them and they said it was OK. There's a lot of work here in summer. 
 [00:09:35.4] So you should come. And I came the next year alone. And I fell in love with the place again. And then I met my boyfriend, my husband here. And well, every winter we go on holidays somewhere but now we can say that we live here. First years were just a few months here. And then Córdoba, and other places but now we go maybe for one month or two months for vacations. And then we return. 
**Interviewer:** [00:10:09.0] You said that you studied tourism? 
**Laura:** [00:10:13.8] Yes. 
**Interviewer:** [00:10:17.8] Maybe you know about other people, with other jobs, do you know NGOs over here or in Calafate? Like conservationists ... 
**Laura:** [00:10:30.3] Yes. There's an organization here in Chaltén. It's called ... Well, it's a big one, but some members are here. It's called "Ambiente Sur" [South Environment]. And they worked in this place for two areas, that are protected. One is here, there's a lagoon there. And the other one is the shore over the river. To protect those areas. 
 [00:11:02.5] This is the Andian Club. There's an indoor wall. 
 [00:11:37.3] [Small talk to contact them.]
**Interviewer:**  [00:12:13.2] Are Calafate and Chaltén different from each other? 
**Laura:** [00:12:16.7] Very different, yeah!! Both places are ... Well, the same main activities, in tourism. But Chaltén is much smaller and more oriented in mountain trekking and Calafate [x] a lot in the last years, because it's in a very open area, and it's not like Chaltén that's surrounded by the National Park. 
 [00:12:44.2] So that's like the limit of the town. In Calafate, well, the expansion was huge. Actually nowadays there are close to 40,000 inhabitants in Calafate. It's very big. And well, the main attraction is the National Park but there are more options for those who don't want to walk. In Chaltén it's mainly trekking. Not many options by car or in town. 
**Interviewer:** [00:13:17.1] So a different type of visitor.
**Laura:** [00:13:19.1] Yes! Normally people go to both but there's a lot of people that go just to Calafate and don't come to Chaltén. Or some people come just for the day, to Chaltén, by bus. 
**Interviewer:** [00:13:36.5] They come to climb Mount Fitz Roy and then they go back. 
**Laura:** [00:13:39.9] [Laughters.]
**Interviewer:** [00:13:54.7] 40,000 people you said.
**Laura:** [00:13:54.7] Yes! I heard that number a few days ago and I couldn't believe it. 
**Interviewer:** [00:14:01.7] And that's throughout the year, even in winter? 
**Laura:** [00:14:03.7] Yeah. Calafate became a bigger city so, well, it's not so limited as Chaltén, with the activities that in winter it's not impossible but it's not the same to try to do a hike, or climbing in winter. The activities in Calafate, even in the Perito Moreno Glaciar it's running almost all year around. 
 [00:14:32.5] They close just one month I think and there's tourism in low season of course, but there's tourism all year around. Chaltén is changing in the last years, and more places are still open in winter. But most of the restaurants, hotels, cabins, are closed in winter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:14:56.2] So you live here in the winter? 
**Laura:** [00:14:59.0] Yes. I have a daughter, two year old. So, well, in the last years we are staying more here, and just travelling in winter just to visit family and in vacations. But we don't work much in winter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:15:20.6] Does it get very cold in the winter? 
**Laura:** [00:15:23.6] It's cold but it's not extremely cold. Some days could be like 10-15 degrees below zero, but only a few days. And we can get snow in town but in the last winters just for a few days. Actually there's
 [00:15:45.2] a very small ski lift, for people in town, next to the town. And this year they couldn't put it because there wasn't enough snow, in the mountains. But here in town ...
**Interviewer:** [00:16:04.5] And is the wind better in winter?
**Laura:** [00:16:07.7] Well the theory is that in winter there's less wind but you can still get very strong winds. But normally it's in summer that we get more wind because there's something about the pressure, the ocean, the high pressure centres, between the ocean and the coast, in summer there's more difference so this is more attraction for the winds. And in winter it's more stable. But we had strong winds in the last winters. 
 [00:16:38.1] But it's nice, it's very calm. Very relaxed. The days are shorter. 
**Interviewer:** [00:16:44.8] Yeah, we've been lucky for the last three days. The first day that we arrived the wind was so strong. It was difficult just to walk. 
**Laura:** [00:16:59.0] Yes. We've had very windy days in the last week. 
**Interviewer:** [00:17:06.0] Someone told us that during very windy days a kayak showed up in their front. It just came from somewhere. 
**Laura:**  [00:17:18.5] [Laughters] A lot of things blow away in a windy day. 
**Interviewer:**  [00:17:32.5] We live in a small island, 4,000 people. So we like quiet. 
**Laura:** [00:17:47.0] Yes. Well. It's like the style of the town because there are no high buildings but it's expanding and growing. 
**Interviewer:** [00:18:16.7] How often do you [x]?
 **Laura:** [00:18:25.9] Well, in the last years, that I have my daughter, I don't work as much as I used to. I used to work like 25 days a month. But not anymore. My husband is also a mountain guide. So, well today for example we are both working but this is a short day for me. So, it's OK. Otherwise, we don't work at the same time. So, 
 [00:18:52.9] just a few days a month in the last years. 
**Interviewer:** [00:19:00.9] [Question inaudible]
**Laura:** [00:19:03.2] The most popular hikes are this one, Torre, and Fitz Roy Trail. So, ... 
 [00:19:59.4] There's a view of town from there so we can stop. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:20:19.7] [Comment]
**Laura:**  [00:20:19.7] Yes. Just to walk the day hikes here on the trails I like, lighter boots, otherwise it's too hot. 

**Laura:** [00:22:08.4] Have you seen those? 
**Interviewer:** [00:22:11.4] Not here! But we have them back home. [Maybe we can stop over here, or maybe too windy?]
**Laura:** [00:22:37.1] Well, once we get into the valley it's going to be less windy. Normally it's more windy here, next to the town. This is a good view of the town. And then we are getting into the valley, and we will see the river, and in a few minutes more we start to see the mountains. So here you see how the town is surrounded, over here by the National Park, and two rivers: Las Vueltas, and Fitz Roy River on the side that we're going to see from the hike. 
 [00:23:06.4] This is the newer part of the town. There are a lot of new constructions. Well, the town, I don't know if you know about the origin of the town. [We always like to here your perspective.] Well, the first buildings are from 1985 when the government decided to establish a settlement close to the border. At that moment, there were some problems, some tension with Chile to define the border in certain points, and this was an area that was at that moment not defined.
 [00:23:41.3] So, in a way to establish a settlement close to the border, the government took this land that was National Park, and established the first official buildings in the area. Well, at that moment, the area was already known by climbers and explorers from all over the world. And from that moment, the government encouraged people to come here, to establish here, 
 [00:24:14.2] from that moment on. Gave the land to people who wanted to come here. So people started to build, and to offer more touristic lodges, restaurants, and started to grow. And in the last 10, 15 years with the port in Calafate, and the road that was paved, tourism increased a lot. And it's the main activity here. And trekking and climbing is still the main attraction of the area and the mountains. 
 [00:24:50.4] The town is growing very fast, and we can see that in each lot there is two or three houses. It's a problem that we have in town that there's no more land around, so each lot is building one or two houses, and there are some houses on like skis, to move. And people also living in trailers, and 
 [00:25:20.7] well, some people are coming in summer to live, in winter they return to their places. But a lot of people is establishing here and well trying to live in this place. So it's a problem that we have here that there's no more land here in town, but a lot of people is asking for land. So the government is ... Well, trying to find a solution for that, to expand the town somewhere. 
 [00:25:48.5] But, well, there's still no decision. 
**Interviewer:** [00:25:53.5] And so they haven't put a limit on the amount of people that can live here? 
**Laura:** [00:25:58.4] Well, no. For the people who want to live here no. Because there's a lot of work here. And the hotels and the restaurants need people to work. So there are a lot of new places opening, and well, people is coming to work and live here, specially more in summer, but well, all year around. 
**Interviewer:** [00:26:22.8] So to apply for land you have to be a resident, to live here for some time? 
**Laura:** [00:26:28.0] Yes. There's no strict rule about that. For example I'm applying for land for ten years. And I'm still waiting. For some people it's faster, for some people it's slower. But yeah. First of all you have to live here. That's compulsory. 
**Interviewer:** [00:27:04.4] Is land expensive? 
**Laura:** [00:27:06.3] Well, if you get the land from the government it's not expensive at all. They charge like the taxes. The real price of the land is not expensive, but then if you want to buy from another owner, because once you get the land it's yours, and then if you want you can sell it... If you want to buy to another owner, it's really expensive. The prices are crazy. 
 [00:27:36.5] Because there are not many available. 

**Interviewer:** [00:28:57.1] Food can be expensive here too, compared to ...?
**Laura:** [00:29:01.8] Yes! It is because everything is coming from at least 3,000 kilometres, by truck. So yes, it's very expensive and specially the fresh: vegetable, fruits, it's quite difficult to get here. Now in summer there are more trucks coming and places more full of options. But in winter, potatoes are [a nuisance?]. Apples!
**Interviewer:** [00:29:32.6] The internet seems to be all over!
**Laura:** [00:29:33.5] Yes! It's very slow because it's satellite. We don't have the wire, the optical fibre. The connection by wire. So yes, it's very slow and there's only one company that offers internet. 
**Interviewer:** [00:29:54.5] Has it been getting better? 
**Laura:** [00:29:56.9] No. Well, yeah, it's better than six, seven years ago. Yeah. But now more people is using internet. All places are offering wi-fi. So the connection is not enough for everyone. But I heard that another company is going to bring internet through another connection, so should be better.
**Interviewer:** [00:30:35.7] Yeah. This morning, one of the reasons we were late is that we had to send some paperwork to the National Park Administration and it was urgent and the internet was dying. It seemed like it was dead everywhere. 
**Laura:**  [00:30:54.1] Yes! The same happened at home. And yesterday I spent like one hour trying to send ten pictures. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:32:17.7] It's warm today. 
**Laura:**  [00:32:25.4] Yup. 
**Interviewer:** [00:32:32.8] [Inaudible far away.]
**Laura:** [00:32:40.3] All the hikes in the National Park, there's a sign with some of the rules, and the explanation of the trail. The trail that we are going to do today, is this one. We are going to reach Torre View Point. And the trail is going all the way to Laguna Torre, following this river there's a way out of the lagoon, it's called Fitz Roy River. It's the one that you crossed at the entrance of town, here with the bridge. So up to this point, it's going to be 2.5 kilometres. 

**Interviewer:** [00:33:41.0] Warmest day!!! [Like summer.]
**Laura:** [00:33:41.0] Yes! And with no wind, that changes everything. Because it's normally the wind that you feel like colder. 

**Interviewer:** [00:34:06.7] As guides, you normally don't use canes? 
**Laura:** [00:34:08.7] Sometimes. I always take one on these day hikes. If I go on a longer expedition I take both. With a big back pack, or on steep trails, yes. I use them. 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:28.4] So there not just for beginners...
**Laura:** [00:34:30.5] No. Not at all. No no no. 
**Interviewer:** [00:34:32.2] Because I brought two poles and I thought that the last time was so difficult, that I didn't know beforehand, so I didn't bring them over. And I thought this one was easy but I think already would have been good to bring them. 
**Laura:** [00:34:45.3] Yes. It's not only for beginners. I find them very good for the knees. Specially going down. Or with a big backpack, if you twist an ankle or whatever, they give you more stability. 
**Interviewer:** [00:35:03.0] I had them for the mini trekking... 

**Interviewer:** [00:35:29.1] This is a busier trail than Pliegue Tumbado...
**Laura:** [00:35:37.2] Yes. Pliegue Tumbado I think is a great hike but it's not so popular. No matter what people come to this one and Fitz Roy. And also these two hikes are connected in a loop with camping areas. So for the girl with a big backpack, she was camping and she's coming on these hikes. Pliegue Tumbado is ... You can go on the same hike, the first part, to Vuelta al Huemul, to the Huemul circuit. 
 [00:36:12.3] But, these two hikes are the most popular. 
 [00:36:24.5] And this is the highest, of the seasons. And it's a sunny day. 

**Interviewer:** [00:37:21.1] Where do visitors come from when coming to Chaltén?
**Laura:** [00:37:26.3] Well, from all over the world. A lot from Europe. And from the States and Canada. In the last years more from Argentina. But it's still a very expensive area to come. But now it's more expensive to go abroad, a lot of Argentinians in the last years started to come to this part of Patagonia. Depending on agencies, 
 [00:37:55.1] some agencies are more specialized in Americans or French or German. I work a lot with people from the States, for example. 
**Interviewer:**  [00:38:10.5] That explains why your English is so good. 
**Laura:** [00:38:13.8] Well, many years speaking in English everyday ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:38:24.0] Benji mentioned, I understand a good 90% Spanish, because I speak Italian. I want to thank you for speaking English. 
**Laura:** [00:38:38.4] No problem. 

**Laura:** [00:39:34.8] Would you like to use my walking pole? 
**Interviewer:** [00:39:37.6] Sure!! Thank you so much!

**Laura:** [00:40:27.3] So as you see in just a few metres the vegetation and the environment changes a lot. We get more into the forest. The forest in this part here of Patagonia is a very narrow area, close to the mountain range on the west side of the continent. And the reason is the amount of precipitation coming from the Pacific Ocean. 
 [00:40:53.2] So this is the natural forest from the area with two species: lengas and ñires. Both are notofagus. That's the name of the family of those trees. 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:07.0] When you have a moment can you show us which one is which? 
**Laura:** [00:41:13.2] OK. Here these are lengas, but ... When we have both next to the trail I'll show you. There's a very small difference in the leave. Both are very similar and both are [desiduous?]. 

**Laura:** [00:42:25.0] This is a nice shot from here. 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:12.4] It's also very bright today. [Yes!]
**Laura:**  [00:43:24.0] You don't wear sunglasses? 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:24.9] No. It'll make it difficult to [film?]. And the same with sunscreen. I try to avoid it as much as possible. I'll do a hike one of these days without a camera. 
**Laura:** [00:43:50.1] Yeah. The sun here is very strong. Normally you don't realize because with the wind you don't feel it so hot, but the sun for skin and eyes is very strong.
**Laura:** [00:44:13.6] Just a few metres more and we get to the viewpoint. 

**Laura:** Gandalf's stick!! [Some fans in the area: Rivendel!! ... ] Well, yes! Actually where the movie was made has a resemblance, the forests in New Zealand, are from the same family of trees that I pointed out: notofagus. So they are similar.  
**Interviewer:** [00:46:33.3] Someone explained, when the Earth got separated, it's the same tectonic plate broken ...
**Laura:** [00:46:38.9] Yes! So they travelled and adapted differently in each place, but with the same origin. 

**Laura:** [00:49:21.8] Great view from here. This is our first viewpoint. From here we can see both ranges: Fitz Roy on the right, and Torre on the left. Now the summit of Cerro Torre is in the clouds. We are going to the saddle there, to the lower part. That's the viewpoint and that's the highest point along this valley. There on the left is Cerro Solo. The one with a glaciar on top, and crevices. 
**Interviewer:** [00:49:52.7] Have you ever climbed Fitz Roy? 
**Laura:** [00:49:54.9] No. I like climbing, but I'm not so technical. 
**Interviewer:** [00:50:06.4] You know, we often find ourselves in beautiful mountain landscapes and I think I enjoy the peace, and the relaxation of being around the mountains, much more than I would ever enjoy the challenge of being on top of it. 
**Laura:** [00:50:27.9] Yes. I think the attraction of those things is the challenge, but then don't know how much, ... When you're doing it is enjoying and how much is the stress, the challenge, being tired.
**Interviewer:** [00:50:43.2] The more the stress, the more you enjoy I think. 
**Laura:** [00:50:47.0] Maybe at the end you enjoy it or some seconds on the summit you say: Wow, this is great. But yeah. 
**Interviewer:** [00:50:57.4] A woman the other day has climbed Fitz Roy 3 times, and she's like: your idea is to just get there. You're down here and you want to get up there, and when you're up there you just want to get back there. 
**Laura:** [00:51:11.0] What's her name?
**Interviewer:**  [00:51:11.0] Milena. [Ah, yeah.] She was fun. We sure are lucky that we got the whether, a sunny day like today. 
**Laura:** [00:51:27.5] Yeah. Great day, and I love when there are some clouds, more than just blue sky. 

**Laura:** [00:52:8.7] Look at the condor there. 
**Interviewer:**  [00:52:17.0] Is it Córdoba's provincial animal ...?
**Laura:**  [00:52:19.5] I don't know but there are a lot there in Sierras Grandes. 
**Laura:** [00:52:46.8] Did you take pictures yesterday? The sunset!!
**Interviewer:**  [00:53:14.3] April, take your headphones off, it's not safe.
**Laura:** [00:53:14.3] A puma is running straight to you... [A condor!]

**Interviewer:** [00:54:23.6] How did you decide to become a guide?
**Laura:**  [00:54:27.0] Well, when I finished high school I didn't know what to study, and one option was tourism. I liked photography, tourism, I didn't know, and well I thought that tourism was a good option because I enjoy travelling, knowing different cultures, and more that part than the agencies. So I studied tourism in the beginning in Córdoba.
 [00:54:57.5] I became a touristic guide and then I came here. First year I worked at an office, selling tours. And no. I was crazy there in the office. Wanting to go out. Jealous from the guides coming from the hikes. And I said: No, I want to do that. So then I did the mountain guide course, to become a mountain guide, and be able to guide here. So yeah, I really really enjoy it. 

**Laura:** [00:55:40.7] It's a good way to be in nature, exercise, and work at the same time.
**Interviewer:** [00:55:46.7] Yeah. You don't need to go to the gym. 
**Laura:** [00:55:52.1] In season that's impossible. 
**Interviewer:** [00:55:55.5] You have to find a way to do LESS exercise. 
**Laura:** [00:55:56.3] Yeah! 
 [00:56:03.0] It's a very demanding job but it's just for the summer months. And then we have long holidays in winter. So it works very well. 

**Laura:** [00:57:00.4] Have you seen the porcelain orchids? [Yes! Beautiful!!!!] 
 [00:57:27.1] They'll remain just for a few weeks more and then, they'll be gone. 

**Laura:** [00:57:54.1] Did you already know this area?
**Interviewer:** [00:57:56.8] I came to Calafate 15 years ago. But not Chaltén. It's incredible.
**Laura:** [00:58:05.8] Well yes, 15 years ago the road was gravel. It wasn't as well known. Except if you were a climber.
**Interviewer:** [00:58:13.3] Well, I did know about here, but we had been driving from Córdoba. It was crazy the amount of kilometres we had drove, and it was not only a matter of time and driving a gravel road, but you can't be sure that you'll make it through without being left stranded. So at the time we decided not to come over. But I'm sure it was a totally different thing. 
**Laura:** [00:58:36.5] Yes!
**Interviewer:** [00:58:45.5] You say that a lot of people come for hiking, and climbing. Is there more of one or another? 
**Laura:** [00:58:54.8] I believe it's more of a massive thing for people to do the hiking, over the world. But even so, climbing is becoming quite a trend in the whole world. In cities, with indoor walls, there's a lot of people climbing nowadays. That's what my partner would tell me, he's a guide as well, and it's impressive the amount of foreigners that come over with their own climbing equipment. 
 [00:59:25.4] Perhaps they're not going to climb a peek, but they do manage to do some sport climbing near town. It's becoming more of a massive thing. But even with these mountains, they're not for beginners. 

**Laura:** [01:02:51.5] So one of nine kilometres to the lake. We're doing two and a half. But the first one is very long, because starting from the hotel... 
**Interviewer:** [01:03:04.7] Do you know how much is the vertical distance? 
**Laura:** [01:03:09.2] 250 metres. But there are like little hills. Up and down. 

**Laura:** [01:06:59.5] So look at this rock. As you see, the surface is very polished. Well the glacier was passing on it. And this is a rock originally from this mountain. There were other rocks that were travelling with the glacier. But this means that the glacier was right on this rock. There are like scratches, striations on the rock, on the direction that the glacier was moving. Passing and carrying all this valley. 
 [01:07:29.6] That's why the shape is rounded around these mountains. 
 [01:08:03.6] I can notice that there was a good amount of people camping over here. [Is it dirty?] Because of the big backpacks. 
**Interviewer:** [01:08:12.5] Perhaps that's for free now and later on ... 
**Laura:** [01:08:14.7] It has always been free and the entrance to the Park is also free. Some years ago, Parques Nacionales tried to charge a fee, but it's very difficult here in Chaltén because the Park is so near to the town, so where would they charge? In the header of the trail? People would walk through another place nearby. In the highway? Can't do so either, because it's a provincial road. And there's people who come to the town and don't come to the Park. 
 [01:08:42.5] So there was a little fuzz there with people from Chaltén and they decided, for now, not to charge. It's the same National Park that does get charged to see Perito Moreno Glacier.
**Interviewer:**  [01:08:59.7] I was going to comment on that. When I went to Perito Moreno, 15 years ago, they wouldn't charge anything. And I even got to camp inside the Park. In the bay, almost in front of the glaciar. 
**Laura:** [01:09:08.7] Yes. The campings are for free. You don't even need to register. But if they begin to overflow, perhaps at some point they do demand that you register. 
 [01:09:33.3] En Calafate, the camping area is in Lago Roca. It's not right next to the Glaciar as before. When it all became more massive, they decided to remove that camping section. Imagine if with the current amount of tourists, if they'd all camp there ... And also, before there just used to be a path to see the glacier. There were wooden board walks, and then there was a coast trail. Just a small path. But with the current amount of people it's not allowed anymore.
 [01:10:08.2] So they made the metal footbridges, walkways. 

**Interviewer:** [01:11:06.8] Is there erosion around trail a problem here? Could you explain from the start stating the word erosion, to avoid my voice from the recording?
**Laura:** [01:11:08.1] Yes. It is. It's a big problem. 
 [01:11:44.3] Erosion is a big problem here in the path. And the rangers are working a lot. Almost everyday checking on each trail, and trying to keep only one trail, one path, but well, it's still a big problem. Specially on the steep parts of the trail with all the people walking it's very difficult to control it. There are some parts, some paths on this part of the park that people came from an organization, 
 [01:12:26.0] from the States, to work. And to teach the rangers how they work in their country, to avoid erosion, and to make the steps and to work on that. So yeah. The rangers are very concerned all the time about that. In the park there's still no limit of the number of people walking everywhere. But maybe in a few years if the amount of people increases, in some parts they will start to control.
 [01:13:03.2] To try to keep it with less people to protect the damage on the trails. 
 [01:13:15.1] Well, if you want to ask more specifically about that in the National Park Office, here in Chaltén, the guides that work on this, some of them speak very good English. Some of them are very very involved with this thing and they can explain what they are doing. 
 [01:13:40.6] I know there's a program of volunteers to work on the path. They are asking for people to work in the park as volunteers for one, two, three days. Because the number of tourists is increasing a lot, and they are just a few guides working and the amount of kilometres they have to cover is a lot.
 [01:14:14.7] So they started with this program this season. 
**Interviewer:** [01:14:27.1] We find that National Parks are very tourism oriented and some are very conservation oriented. So, in your opinion, do you think in this case what are the NP priorities? 
**Laura:** [01:14:46.5] I think that they have a very good balance between the touristic activity and conservation. Because they control a lot and they are very concerned about nature and conservation, but at the same time ... They are not closing trails or they are not preserving this areas that are very popular.
 [01:15:25.2] But they do have some areas that are very protected. And it's forbidden to go to those areas. But I think they have a very good balance. 
**Interviewer:** [01:15:44.3] Are they open to community input and feedback?
**Laura:** [01:15:56.2] Yes. The NP in this area is our back [yard]? So there's a very good relation  between population and the NP. Actually the workers from the NP go and help if there's a fire near town, and they work together a lot. They organize lectures for kids. They take them to some hikes. And they are very involved with the community and the culture of the place. 

**Laura:** [01:17:23.0] If you have time you should go to the visitor's center. I have a friend working there. I can tell her about the program and maybe she can ask somebody to talk with you, and ...
**Interviewer:** [01:17:42.1] In dealing with them ...
**Laura:** [01:17:45.8] Ah! The official part! 
**Interviewer:** [01:17:47.7] For permits and fees and insurance [Yeah!] 
**Laura:** [01:17:57.9] Maybe you are communicating with somebody in Calafate, or Buenos Aires... 
 [01:18:19.6] That's one thing about being here next to the Park. That we work together a lot. We are friends with the people, but work in the NP, and we help each other, and it's not like in other parts that the community is one thing and the enemy is the Park. 
**Interviewer:** [01:18:49.1] Has it always been like this? Or have things changed over the years? 
**Laura:** [01:18:54.5] No. I think that in Chaltén it was always like this. The park and the community trying to work together, to make the best for everybody. 
 [01:19:17.9] There's a big problem for example with the dogs, going into the park. Because the town is next to the park, there are no fences. So the dogs are almost everyday going to the park and the rangers bring in the dogs back. And of course there are some problems of being so close. But in general we get along very well. 
**Interviewer:** [01:19:47.9] How are dogs a problem? 
**Laura:** [01:19:51.4] Dogs are a problem because a lot of people have dogs outside of the house with no fences. So the dogs are running everywhere, going around and getting into the National Park, chasing birds, chasing native animals. With all the diseases of the domestic animals. So, 
 [01:20:23.1] the Park doesn't want the dogs going into the territory. 
**Interviewer:** [01:20:39.1] In a recent trip to Japan in a very remote island, with a lot of endemic bird species and they had a [x] problem there. Settlers brought a lot of cats with them to get rid of mice. And then ... 

**Laura:** [01:22:23.7] On this hike, before getting to the viewpoint there's a place where we can drink the water. 
**Interviewer:** [01:22:35.3] It's one of the things that we can do easily where we live. 
**Laura:** [01:22:50.4] Luckily here, we still have good water in the mountains. 
 [01:23:24.9] From here we have like 15 minutes up and we get to the viewpoint. It's the steep part of the trail. So you'll stay here and wait for us? [Yup!]

**Interviewer:** [01:24:54.3] They wanted to grow beavers over Tierra del Fuego...?
**Laura:**  [01:24:54.3] Yes. They wanted to use their skin, and then they didn't adapt to the whether. Now they are pandemic. I even heard that they crossed the Straight of Magellan. So they're already on Chilean side. Even to same parts of continental Patagonia. It would be a problem because, since they are nocturnal it's very hard to see them and hunt them. And the forests die all in the surrounding area. 
 [01:25:52.9] It's not like the places from which they are native, where the forest is adapted to them. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:29:17.3] The viewpoint is 15 minutes from here?
**Laura:** [01:29:17.3] Yes. It's very close. Just 500 metres in distance but a big elevation gain. 

**Laura:** [01:31:25.9] There's a mountain film festival in February in Chaltén. 
 [01:32:14.0] Have you seen the Calafate with the fruits? These are all Calafates. But I can't see the fruits on these plants. 
 [01:32:42.0] This is the Calafate. But the fruits are ... They must be very dark color. There's a legend that says that if you try the Calafate you will come back to Patagonia. 
 [01:33:12.5] Maybe you can try the ice cream, it's very good. There's an ice cream shop in town. 

**Laura:** [01:39:18.3] That's the little stream where it's possible to take water to drink. You can take some shots. 
**Interviewer:** [01:39:37.9] It gets suddenly colder. 
**Laura:** [01:39:37.9] Yes. In the shadows. 

**Laura:** [01:42:19.1] It's very common to see in the forest, some trees with some branches or the tree itself fallen because the wind is very strong. And the wood is not so hard. Normally the trees are dead inside and the bark is alive so then they break easily. 

**Laura:** [01:45:22.1] There are some years that it's full of those. And now is one of those years. Don't touch them because they produce a kind of allergy on the skin. 

**Interviewer:** [01:47:59.3] Trail erosion! Are there environmental callings in the park? 
**Laura:** [01:48:05.1] A very big risk is the fire. We never had a big fire here like there were in Torres del Paine, in Chile, which is quite close to this area. Same kind of environment. They had fires that were for like one month, burning all the area. 
 [01:48:31.4] And it's a big risk. That's why fires are not allowed, in the Park. If you're camping you have to take a stove. And if a fire starts it's very difficult to stop it. The whether is very dry. There are no routes. No access to get to many parts in the Park. So the rangers are very concerned about that all the time. 
 [01:49:02.1] Checking in each place, we ask guides with the radio if we see something. Some people camping... Making a fire or whatever. We always call the rangers. And I know they stopped some little fires but we never had a big one. I think that's another big problem in the Park. 
 [01:49:31.4]  And then well, the rescues. If there's an accident in the mountains the only way to take the person down is with a stretcher, walking. So they need a lot of people for that. Normally you need, depending where, about 30 people helping. So, rangers, volunteers, mountain guides, people from the town: when there's an accident, 
 [01:50:01.5] a group from the mountain club from Chaltén, they organize themselves and they go with a stretcher and with all the technical gear they need to take the person down. One thing is here in the low parts of the mountains, and then sometimes it happens that there are accidents in the mountains, so that's a big thing. 
 [01:50:31.4] Sometimes they can get a helicopter from Calafate, from other parts, but normally you have to go with a group of people and bring the person down with a stretcher. It takes many hours, and of course a big risk for everybody. 
 [01:50:56.7] Well, we are getting to the viewpoint, we are going to stop here for some minutes. 
 [01:51:44.5] This is the highest point along the valley. Then the trail to get to Laguna Torre, it's going down and then quite flat to reach the lake.
