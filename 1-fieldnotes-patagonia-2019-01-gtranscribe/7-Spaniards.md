### Spaniards @ Calafate [2019 01]

 [00:12.3] April: Could you introduce yourselves, who you are, what are your names, what you do, and where we are right now? 
 [00:37.2] Benji: I always considered this interview to be different from the rest since you are not from around, but have been travelling and are now staying for the season here. So could you please tell us how long you've been travelling through South America and Argentina, your plans, how you've been able to work around over here and then go on?
  [01:01.8] HIM: We are a Spaniard couple. I am from Cáceres 
 [01:04.1] HER: I am from Barcelona. We already lived together in Barcelona. We had our steady jobs, our flat, and after a year and half of planning, we left everything behind and we came over to destiny: the World. For one or another reason we flied over to Buenos Aires. And from there on we have been moving for three months along South America. 
 [01:34.6] HIM: More than three months and a half already. [Laughters] And specifically here in Patagonia for a month. 
 [01:45.9] HER: We arrived to Ushuaia by December 27th. And we're still here. [Laughters]. And we'll see how it goes. Because in this area, we now have over here South, at least until the end of February. Because it's when we have the reservations to make the O, in Torres del Paine. And that's what right now keeps us moving around this area, without moving further upwards. 
 [02:11.5] HIM: And also, to keep travelling for a longer time, and spending the least possible, so, we are working now at a hostel, doing reception desk, making breakfast, little things of that type. In exchange for lodging and food. So that's a way to keep on travelling without spending anything at all, at really getting to know around,
 [02:41.6] culture, getting deeper into the local culture. And how people live around here. For example, in Calafate.
 [02:54.9] Phil: Benji, could you translate a bit for us? [Benji: The sound is different! (since they're from the Real Spanish)] [Laughters]
 [03:40.1] HER: [In English: People use to say that we speak really fast] [Phil: It's not the speed, just strange. I've never been to Spain. 
 [03:56.7] HER: [In English: Yes, over here it is a bit contaminated. [Laughters] We change the verb tenses, or "aquí" instead of "acá". We are already adopting some these words.] 
 [04:26.3] Phil: UK English and from Canada and the States. 
 [04:37.8] HIM: Yes. You can realize this quickly once someone starts speaking. 
 [04:53.7] [Benji translates]
 [05:30.4] Maybe you've got the reservation for Chile once you got to Argentina? 
 [05:28.2] HER: No. We did that from Uruguay. 
 [05:33.1] HIM [In English]: We got that in October. But it's very difficult to get a reservation for the whole circuit, the old one, the big one. So we wanted to travel North before because we have to go South to reach Torres del Paine. So we are staying here, and then in Chaltén. 
 [06:01.4] And using this volunteering [?] to keep our expenses low
 [06:07.0] HER [In English]: Yeah, but this volunteering is not done because we have to go to Torres del Paine. In fact this is the third volunteering we do, here in Argentina. It's part of our travel. We are not like tourists that we are going to this place, take some pictures, do this track, and go there and there. Volunteering is not only a way to reduce expenses, it's a way to really live the place and to 
 [06:37.8] decrease the velocity of the travel. Because previous to this one, we have been for one month moving around. We did all the coast of Uruguay, we did Iguazú Falls, Buenos Aires, Ushuaia. OK, we need to stop. So, this kind of volunteering, this kind of help, or start working for accommodation and food gives us an opportunity to set a little routine.  
 [07:08.9] And to clean your clothes. To buy some jeans. 
 [07:15.4] HIM [English becoming default]: At least we know that when you're travelling very fast you're going to reach a spot everyday. There's a moment when you're always taking decisions and whether where are we going to sleep today, what are we going to eat today. We have to buy this, to get this. And we have to go to that bus, that can get us to that city. And then we have to go on these planes... These things make you at least 
 [07:44.1] know that you're going to have a bed, food. You can also focus on other stuff. And for example we wanted to make a webpage and a blog. We didn't know anything about blogging or webdesign, but we wanted to do it. And we're really proud that 10 days ago almost, we launched it. And it's quite good I think. At least visually. It's quite good. 
 [08:17.9] We have to make a lot of content and so. But it's also a way of doing the stuff that you can't do when you travel normally. 
 [08:38.7] Phil: We get it. We were late to the experience. Travelling can be a lot more. 
 [08:42.7] HER: Now we are discovering. We are travelling. But we are not only tourists or travellers. It's different. It's a different experience. It's a different thing that you're looking for. And we like to establish in a place and discover more of the local people: what they do, and ...
 [09:07.8] HIM: How do they live. What are the problems of the places that you see. Something so common, and that you don't usually see like an electricity bill: wow, this people pay these taxes or this one, or they have this problem with these companies. And it's a thing that ... You will never think about it. But when you live with a person from that place, 
 [09:43.3] and you talk everyday with them, you really find, and you can get the difference between your country and the places you have been, and places where you are staying today and it's like: this is really strange. For me this would be impossible in my country. And for him it's normal. Or is used to it. It's another way of knowing [about] the people. [HER: Inaudible]
 [10:16.5] And not only take pictures. 
 [10:19.5] Phil: So whatever you discovered from El Calafate, can you tell us what life is like here, from your perspective? Can you pretend that the people that are listening have never been around?
 [10:43.0] HER: The biggest point that I have troubles with is the wind. You never think that the wind is a weather condition that really bothers you. And really affects you in your daily life. For example, we like going running. And we go to the coast, the coast area of the lake, and it's nice. You go running. 
 [11:11.9] And in one direction you run really fast, and it's really amazing. And then you just turn around and you have the strong wind in your face, and you don't move from there, in the place you stay. It's really terrible. Not even running. If you only go out for a walk. It's "OK, this is a nice day, let's go to the coast", and the wind is so hard that it's: "fooh, I cannot stand that, I need to come back". 
 [11:41.4] And this is a point that has really surprised me. The Patagonian wind. 
 [11:48.4] HIM: Actually, the climate here, it's amazing. It's really strange, because we are in the middle of desert but it's a cold desert, but there's the biggest lake in Argentina, that is just 100 meters away. So it's quite strange how all those things can be together but it's true. And there's always wind but there's always wind coming from the same direction and it's like 
 [12:26.6] geographically and climate wise, it's a very strange, or very ... authentic place.  And once you discover Perito Moreno, which is like amazing, astonishing,  
 [12:55.3] it's even more ... 
 [12:59.8] HER: It's like things don't fit with the others. Like, it's all desert, but there's a big lake. You go to the Perito Moreno, and it's "OK, it's hills with forest and boom!! A big piece of ice!! Why? I cannot understand this place". But it's amazing. Because it's really different from everything we have seen, or that we have in Spain.
 [13:27.6] HIM: I suppose that the first people who arrived here must be, should've been really confused by the place. It's like very hostile but at least ... but on another hand, it shouldn't have been so, because it's also: there's water, [HER: guanacos do it ...] It's strange. I think if someone likes nature,
 [13:56.8] I think it's an amazing ... A place that you HAVE TO visit. At least for seeing all those things together. All that doesn't seem to fit together. 
 [14:13.8] HER: And about people, not only the place, and the whether. People who live here in general they are really amazing people and as well. And it's a safe place. You can go around, and people say "it's getting dark, yeah you can go out, no problem". Maybe for us, ... I don't know if this is in part because of being near Calafate, or maybe Argentinean people, or Patagonic people, we are not sure, 
 [14:44.6] they say "Here, people or things don't run, only ..."
 [14:53.3] HIM: The expression in Spanish is "In Patagonia there's no haste, the only one running is the wind" [En Patagonia nunca hay prisa. Aquí el único que corre es el viento]. The translation would be "Here in Patagonia nobody is in a hurry, the only ones that goes fast is the wind". 
 [15:10.7] HER: And maybe as your appearance ... There are some things that make us get out of our nerves, because everything is "no, no, I'm going there." And maybe 3 hours later, it's "OK, Calafate is not so big!! Where are you?". It's funny but you learn to live with this thing. Life is relaxed. 
 [15:38.3] HIM: That's another point of travelling this way. You can also learn how the people is in a place. Because here, people ... I don't know if it's because of the whether, or everything, they live like this and they live in a relaxed way and they enjoy being together, and the same as for us maybe, it's annoying to talk with someone and say "no, no, I'm coming". And you wait for an hour and he hasn't arrived yet. 
 [16:17.7] For them it's like something normal. And they don't get mad about it. 
 [16:25.8] HER: But you learn. And adapt. It's nice. 
 [16:35.6] HIM: And being in the hostel, you can see people from all over the world and it's funny seeing these stuff. For example, with Japanese guys, they're more obsessed with these things, because they're really correct. They want things as they ask for them. Which is normal. But sometimes it's funny to see the interaction between a Japanese guy and a 
 [17:05.9] maybe not only Argentinean, but a Colombian, or whatever and they are "No, no, no, relax man, there's no problem. It's half an hour late, doesn't matter".  The Japanese is like crazy. It's funny. 
 [17:25.0] HER: [x] will come from o'clock to half past. OK, which hour? No, this range. Which hour? I don't know. Wait here, and they will appear. [Arrrgh]. [x] We don't know ... our point of view of this, we see the other people from around the world interacting with Calafate annd Patagonia. It's nice. 
 [17:58.5] HIM: And as we have also been here for Christmas, and New Year's Eve, everybody from the hostels are together, we all have dinner for all of us. People were invited to cook their own dishes, and share with everybody. It was really, really funny and really interesting to talk with an Israeli guy, talking with a Korean guy, and 
 [18:31.8] sharing their points of view about everything. Or a French girl talking with Argentinian people. And then they all go partying. It was really nice. 
 [18:49.9] Phil: So your guests, what do they come here for? What are the things that they do here?
 [19:01.8] HER: Normally people here is spending two, three, four days, and they are coming like everybody else to see Perito Moreno. And go to Chaltén, maybe. You can see as well people that, most of them, they're in vacations. So they have some days scheduled and they have to fit it. 
 [19:30.8] But sometimes they're not a priority, but they appear as travellers, like us. And they're relaxed. And [x]. And they're here like everybody else to see Perito, and Chaltén. It's another rhythm. And it's nice. We are ... Saying it's nice a lot [Laughter]. 
 [19:55.4] HIM: And they also ... You can see there's also people who is travelling ... Us for example, through South America from South to North. Or "I am going to South America or America in general from North to South". And you can talk these places, the hostels, are like a way, a place to exchange information like the best travel guide ever ... 
 [20:25.2] because you can talk with people: "No, I am coming from North, I've been to this point and this one, and another." "Well, I have read that this point is dangerous, because of the ... Whatever." "No, no, no. That was a year ago, but now it's perfect and you have to go not only to this point but to this hostel, and this restaurant and the owner's phone number is this: ask him 
 [20:55.4] and ..." it's the best way of getting information. Just interacting with each other. 
 [21:08.2] April: When people come here, when they come back, say they go to the glacier, what are their impressions of what they've just seen? 
 [21:22.0] HER: In general for everybody, us included, the glacier is like breathtaking. It's, I say: "What is this huge piece of ice here?" It's not like any other place. It's cold but it's not extreme. You are not in Antarctica. Wow. It's like, everybody loves it. I think nobody has said a bad word, or 
 [21:52.2] "yeah, it's overestimated". No no. Everybody is fascinated. 
 [22:00.6] April: And typically, what do people do when they come to the glaciers? Do they go trekking, do they do kayaking, go to tours? What is their typical ... ?
 [22:11.6] HIM: You can do everything but ... [HER: The most popular ... ] is just going in front of the glacier to see it from
[22:28.8] HER: the platforms! That's the cheapest option, depending on the traveller as well. The most common thing to see. And another really popular option that we did is the mini trekking. Or Big Ice, depending on your budget and what you want to do. That is going and walking on the glacier. We really recommend that excursion, because it's ...
 [22:56.2] When are you going to walk on a glacier of this kind?
 [23:00.4] Phil: So we have done it. But can you pretend that we haven't and can you tell us what it's all about? 
 [23:10.4] HIM: Yeah. You go on a walk and near the glacier you approximate the glacier and there the guides can they put some crampons to walk on the ice and you actually go over the glacier, with guides that tells you where to go, because it can be dangerous at some point. And they teach you about the 
 [23:40.3] ice formations, and the  [HER: Geography of the glacier]. And all the things that appear on a glacier like Perito Moreno. It's also a strange one. And after that you enjoy with your group a glass of whisky. With glacier ice of course. 
 [24:10.8] HER: That's something nice of the mini trekking that I like: is that you first get to go to the Park. To start the trekking on the glacier, you take a boat. And you cross the channel, or the lake, in front of Perito. For me it was amazing, because you come from the South(West). The glacier is here, and from the bus you start seeing the glacier far, but in different spots. You're like "Uy, the glacier". 
 [24:40.2] But they don't bring you closer to the glacier. You stop before. And you go to a dock to take a boat. And you haven't seen the glacier. "I know it's there". And then you get into the boat, and the boat goes. And in the moment that you take over a piece of land, you see the glacier, but differently in the boat, in it's highness. 
 [25:09.0] For me it was a really magic moment. It was like "Oooohhh!". Everybody goes outside (the boat). Everybody goes to that side of the boat, that is like, "OK, I am a bit afraid that the boat is going to turn around." But for me that moment was amazing: the first sight of the glacier. In fact it was the same ... We took the boat, and the first sight from the water, from behind. I think it's a nice way to discover
 [25:44.6] a place of this kind. And after that they explain to you about some things of the glaciers because it's so particular, Perito Moreno. Because it's not the biggest. It has particularities. And the walk. That is amazing as well. 
 [26:10.3] HIM: Also, a thing that makes this interesting is seeing everybody that goes there really enjoy it: is seeing that the glacier, IT'S ALIVE!! You can hear it. You can see it moving. You can ... Witness how an enormous chunk of ice breaks and goes to the water and everybody is 
 [26:46.1] like afraid of the noise. And it's crazy seeing that stuff moving. And then really seeing that this is happening and this is ALIVE!! Yeah! 
 [27:10.3] Benji: Sometimes it seems that there may be too many activities, that it's gone very touristic, everything around Perito Moreno. And one might be inclined to think that if there's a cheap option, such as going to the runways [pasarelas], maybe it's not so important? Would you say so? Or could you describe it, or recommend for people NOT to go, or GOING? 
 [27:40.9] HIM: I think going to the runways [pasarelas] to those platforms it's an amazing way of seeing the Perito Moreno. It's also a cheap option. But I don't think it's bad, or ... There's a lot people of course. But the experience would be good anyway. [SHE assents in agreement.] You have a really amazing view of the Perito. You can witness what we said about the ice 
 [28:12.0] breaking. Of course the experience is different if you do this, to walk over the glacier. But you can get the essence of the place even with this walk over the platforms.
 [28:35.4] HER: In fact, it's like that the mini trekking is an extra. Because the experience with the Perito: only in the platforms is amazing in itself. Because it's an amazing place, it's an amazing view. And you have a lot of kilometres of platform. It's not like you arrive and there's a viewpoint and a platform for everybody. No no. You can walk. You can spend, not the whole day, because it's too much, but a lot of hours there without getting tired of the glacier. 
 [29:06.5] Mini trekking is very popular and it's highly recommended but it's an extra. It's not, if you don't do the mini trekking you are not going to experience or enjoy the glacier. No no no. The platform itself it's a good experience for everybody. 
 [29:25.2] Phil: Have you guys been on the MarPatag boat? 
 [29:32.5] HIM: He haven't been, we have sold it for customers. But we haven't been there. Actually the people is really happy about it. You move around other glaciers, from all around. And you can also see the icebergs [témpanos de hielo], ice sticks. 
 [30:00.7] And it's also a different way if you don't want to walk so much, and you want a nice experience to actually see the glaciers and not even just Perito Moreno, but you see all of them: two or three. 
 [30:16.4] HER: And we were told that Glaciar Spegazzini, I think, has more ice falling than Perito. Perito has but it's a lottery. And we were told that the other ones have a lot. In fact the other glaciers some years ago, there were options for mini trekking. But the other glaciers are decreasing with the years. 
 [30:44.2] And now it's not safe. And they have stopped this kind of activity. So you can only see them by boat. And I am pretty sure that they should be spectacular as well. And specifically for this phenomenon: the falling. But we cannot say more because we haven't done it. 
 [31:11.0] Phil: I'd be very happy to hear from you, do you think that the glacier is alive? It's one of the things that interests us. If you feel that you need to answer this in Spanish because it's more philosophical, please do. Could you tell how you felt that it was alive, in your experience? 
 [31:44.3] HER [In English]: It was like been a while waiting for an animal with something. I don't know. I know there are deers here, or a bear, or whatever. And you stay expecting like "Oh, it's here, and it's moving"... the sound. Not only the fallings. You are looking and you here the cracks and really all this ice is being pulled towards you. And, 
 [32:18.7] in a different velocity than we do. But you know it's here. It's like ... 
 [32:28.4] HIM: It's like seeing an enormous mountain and knowing that the mountain is moving two meters a year. It's actually quite a long distance for that immense ... 
 [32:44.5] HER: Wasn't it like two metres a day? 
 [32:47.6] HIM: [Whispering: No.] Well, I don't know. 
 [32:49.4] HER: But it was a crazy number. Like: really? It's moving at the velocity? 
 [32:53.8] HIM: And when you walk over it you can hear water flowing down, and in the middle, and you can hear the cracks. And it's like: Oh, there's so much strange, so much forces here, pressures, and the water flowing and erosion and all this is happening here without ...
 [33:26.9] anybody, any men doing nothing. And it's ... You can see, when you are in the platforms, you can hear people talking and that, but some people are just ... She said waiting. They are only hearing what's going to happen. It's like you're nervous and so. And even in Perito Moreno there's a phenomenon, 
 [33:55.4] of the crate, the brake. The ruptures [rupturas]. That a big, an enormous bridge of ice falls to the ground and the people from Calafate says that when you are there for that specific moment, everybody is silent. And when it breaks, some people shout but not because of the joy. They're ...
 [34:25.3] It's frightening even: the earth moving because of that enormous chunk of ice falling, and it's quite a astonishing ... Seeing a force of nature so big and so close, that you can even walk over it. I think it's something that you have to live.  
 [34:55.5] Phil: So, you used a word that is very important to us. You said it's like being in the wild. So, since you guys speak English so well, could you explain what words you would choose in Spanish to say Wild? Are there different words? 
 [35:22.7] HIM: One word could be "salvaje" [savage], 
 [35:23.3] HER: Yeah, but it's ... There's some connotation that are not exactly wild. Wild is ... I have one but I have to remember it. 
 [35:39.0] HIM: In the Wild, would be "en la naturaleza" [in nature], but ...
 [35:47.7] HER: It's a word that I have been looking for some weeks. Not for this because I wanted for my stuff, and I don't remember. "Que no ha sido tocado" [untouched]. "Lugar Virgen" [virginal place] [thinking and whispering] [Laughs! You can cut this part!]
 [36:19.9] Phil: Yeah, you have the silence [dwelling ? x]! 
 [36:22.9] HER: It's like ... [In Spanish] It's like a place that is authentic. A place that is ... I know there's a word, that hasn't been touched, that is ... Indomitable [indómito] ? No, something like that. [HIM: Yes. That could be.] More than savage, it would be indomitable. I think that's the word. Thanks, I've found it. 
 [36:44.5] Phil. That word I understood. I think you just said untamed, untouched. 
 [36:50.0] BOTH: Yes!!
  [36:51.5] HIM: Indomitable would be that haven't been humanized. 
 [36:58.6] HER: Yes. And for me to be in the wild is to be in a place indomitable. Yeah. It's around Perito Moreno with this example. Yes, there's the platforms, the people but the Perito itself is the Perito itself. And you can cover everything and you're with the Perito, in some way. But I think for me, in the Wild is indomitable. 
 [37:27.3] Phil: Is the word "salvaje" different? 
 [37:32.4] HIM: "Salvaje" could be ... And actually there's an example of a film called "Into the Wild", that's called "Hacia rutas salvajes" [Towards wild roads]... But I don't think the connotation is the same. Because we also talk about "salvaje" as something that is cruel, hard [HER: Aggresive sometimes!]   
[37:54.9] And wild didn't have to be like that. 
 [37:57.6] HER: No. In Spanish like the first meaning of "salvaje" is that it's more like a bad word. It's that: aggresive, is hard, is something [HIM: Savage!]. Yes, savage!
 [38:16.9] HIM: But when you talk about the wild maybe some people think about that. About a cobra crawling around your neck. But no. You can be in the wild and just camping in the mountain and you are in the most relaxing place on Earth. 
 [38:35.9] Phil: And so what is the difference between "naturaleza" and "natura salvaje"? 
 [38:46.3] HER: "Naturaleza" could be going around in this coast. "Naturaleza salvaje" ... It sounds strange but you have to deserve it. You have to climb this mountain. You have to go to this place. Not everybody goes there. You won't see a big group of tourists for that, because there are tourists that only go with a bus, the bus stops, they go there, take some pictures, and come back. For me,
 [39:13.4] this "wild nature" is that. For us, in the Pyrenees: we went to our route several days. You're in really hard conditions: the cold, it was exhausting, we walked a lot, with a lot of hike. But the views there: we were alone. It's that. It's like you are alone with all this indomitable ["indómito"].
 [39:45.6] This indomitable place. It's like untouched by people. Maybe there are a shelter or something but there are no platforms. This is wild nature.
 [39:58.8] HIM: I think for that the animals, the [x], the place are the best indicators sometimes because there are some animals that you would never see them if it's a place where a lot of people go. [SHE assents] Because they don't want to be with people. So, when you are in a place and you actually see a fox, or an armadillo, 
 [40:28.8] or some specific animals from the area that are rarely seen, it's like: OK, I think you are starting to meet the local people [Laughters]. [HER: The true local people.] You are starting to go into his house. You're out of your house. 
 [40:52.2] Phil. Do you think there's a word in English to say "natura salvaje" or is there a word to say "naturaleza"? 
 [41:06.3] HER: Uf. Maybe my English is not so good. I don't know. [Thinking]
 [41:19.5] HIM: [Also thinking: I don't know.] ... Wilderness. 
 [41:27.6] Phil: Thank you! In my modest opinion I think you are entirely right, and you've brought all around for us. That was a very very very intelligent and insightful and description. Wouldn't you say? [Laugthters] Absolutely brilliant! Thank you. 
 [41:55.8] April: So wilderness. Well, do you think people come here because they see this as wilderness: the glaciers, the steeps? 
 [42:14.4] HIM: Some of them. There are some people that come here to see wild. Most of the people come here to see because there's a big airport and there's the Perito Moreno. 
 [42:28.4] HER: And there's the Lonely Planet that says "Come here!" But there's some people that stay here and ask "Hey, what more can I do?" I am thinking about the Cañadón. There's a little excursion ... South East, and you follow a river from here the edge of the town and you follow it and it's a really great excursion. Because you are in a desert but this river, with everything around it, it's green. There are little trees, and it's like a 
 [43:06.3] little oasis, that follows the river. And you walk six kilometres and you arrive to the fall of the desert. It's a little stream of water falling from a rock. And we did it and we came there and we were totally alone. And it was like this situation: maybe not extremely tiring but it was like we discovered this place, and we are in this place sharing with nature. 
 [43:34.6] In fact we were walking and a lot of rabbits, the other kind of rabbit. There name in English ...  Running. Running around but like in tens, twenties, a lot. They were living there and there was two strange things walking there, and they were: Ah! And all of them scared, and in fact we have a funny episode with an armadillo. 
 [44:01.3] Because we were in the path, in a photo, and we saw something, coming at us. A dark thing. And it was an armadillo, walking happily in the path. It saw us, it was: Oh shit! He turned and ran. 
 [44:21.2] HIM: In the same path! And it was really funny because the armadillo saw us, we saw him. We stared for a bit, real fast, and he went were he came by. This happened!
 [44:36.8] HER: Ask for this things, and then you go there and enjoy. One of them had maybe a bad episode with white horses. But, if you go to discover the wild, sometimes the wild discovers you as well. But it's, I don't know if unfortunately, or fortunately,
 [45:02.2] there are not so many people looking for this kind of experience of this contact. Unfortunately because they miss it, sorry. But fortunately as well because when something is amazing and it's really popular they build platforms to get there. But people really don't want to deserve or make an effort to go there, to these places, to take a picture, and it totally changes the nature of ... I lost my self! Sorry
 [45:35.3] HIM: Tourism destroys sometimes, for this kind of things, maybe tourism destroys the point of, the essence of that spot. Maybe not for Perito Moreno, because it's like an architectonic place, but for example ... Doing a trek crossing the mountain: 
 [46:05.3] But if you're alone in the mountain and you can feel the place were you have been and you are going, and seeing the animals and stuff. It's normally ... The experience is more authentic and more ... You enjoy it more, than when there's like a cue of people just going there, and you're only watching back packs and 
 [46:36.9] another people running crossing in front of you. 
 [46:40.1] HER: More than seeing people, it's more about people shouting. And it's: Please, you are here, this is an amazing place, enjoy it!!! Talk with each other, shouting ... Go to a bar!! Or to a pub! Please! 
 [46:56.0] HIM: You can see rubbish in a place like that and it breaks all the magic of the place. [SHE assents]
 [47:02.1] HER: For this reason fortunately and unfortunately there are some places that people don't know. 
 [47:10.0] April: So this brings me to another question. Because you're obviously travelling around South America, and we're really interested in this idea of wilderness and wild places. Do you think through your travels, that this idea of wilderness or wild place is a really good way to market a place? To bring economically ... What are your thoughts? 
 [47:37.7] HIM: I think it is. And I think the best example of this, I have learned it here in Argentina, in another natural reserve, which is called Esteros del Iberá, in the North of Argentina. And they talk about, they have a very very small village, mainly dedicated to tourism, but
 [48:07.8] everything is controlled by Parques Nacionales and they talk about the productivity of the place in terms of how many animals have reproduced, we have increased the number of yaguaretés [Panthera onca wild cat species] and it's also a way of productivity. You don't always have ...
 [48:37.8] In some places you see the yield of a land is how many wheat you can get. Or how many any production. But you can also think of it like that. It's also a way of producing. If you can manage to preserve the nature and 
 [49:07.5] get tourism, that can really respect that, you can make profit of it, without harming the essence of the place. 
 [49:19.0] HER: We really liked this place. Maybe it's not the most breathe taking or the more amazing or the more "Oh, the wonderful of the nature ..." This is a really nice place, I really enjoyed it. But what I enjoyed most was that they were [fighting?] ... And the purity was to maintain the wilderness of this place. And they really limit the name of the little boats that go to the wetlands, they limit everything.
 [49:48.4] It's a really difficult place to reach, to go there. And they live from the tourism!! And you, talking with the local people, they say: Yeah, we live from tourists, but we don't want more tourists than we have. 
 [50:06.7] HIM: We don't want a route here. You have to go for 50 kilometres of mud, for arriving there. That is like hell. But it's not [x]. But we don't want a route here. We are OK with ... The people who actually reach this place is because they like this. They don't want this to be crowded. 
 [50:36.3] HER: Yeah, and they are living and they are not poor. And they're exploiting this wilderness. This authentic, and the essence of the natural place. 
 [50:53.2] April: Since you're from Spain, how would you refer to this place? What do you call this area? 
 [51:03.4] HIM: Patagonia... Or Patagonia Argentina. 
 [51:12.5] Benji: I find it quite interesting that it seems that you guys had like a change of life, I might be wrong, if you already had some relationship with the outdoors, but in some way you said that you had a steady life, in Spain, and then you came over here. So my question would be if you believe that now or in the future, you would have in your daily activities a different relationship with the outdoors? 
 [51:41.8] Either if you go back to Spain and have a steady job, or whatever activity you go on with, or staying over here for I don't know how much time? How do you see this in the next 10 years for you? 
  [51:53.3] HIM: It's quite difficult because we don't know where we will be. [SHE laughs ...] But we have always been really into outdoors. And actually our weekends weren't going to parties in Barcelona. Because we preferred to take our car and go to the mountain and sleep in the car and 
 [52:24.9] arriving on Sunday tired and 
 [52:31.2] HER: Start cooking for the week. But ... We always avoid city and crowds. We like outdoors. We like nature. We like ... I like animals and plants. 
 [52:42.5] HIM: It's true that if I have to stay in a place like forever, for the rest of my life, it has to be a place where at least you can have your piece of nature, or wilderness, close. At least close. At least that you can go up once a week, or once a month, you have to have a place to visit, that it's 
 [53:11.4] out of everything. So maybe yes. Maybe we have to ... 
 [53:20.2] HER: Yes, we have a lot of cities that seem nice but for me it's a must: to have the option to get out easily. And go far away from crowds, buildings, and so for example, Buenos Aires sorry, but I don't want to live in Buenos Aires. Or I don't know ...
 [53:41.9] HIM: In big cities in general. 
 [53:41.9] HER: Yes. In big cities in general. I don't know if this is a change, but it's like more of a reaffirmation of: I don't want big cities. I don't know if depending on the town, depending what I will do for a living finally, or if I [x] never. Who knows? But we are like reassuring that we want that. 
 [54:09.8] HIM: And also this travel is a way of understanding ourselves in these terms. Because when you're travelling and you're doing this points in tourism there are stuff that you can't like live different lives. And compare to it to your own life. The life that you had previously. And say: OK, I like the most these things but I don't like those others. So maybe if I want to live a life in a city place forever, 
 [54:47.1] it should have been, should be like this. And not having these ones, and I think it's also a way of learning, discovering yourself. 
 [55:11.0] April: That was wonderful. Thank you so much.
