**End** \[02:03:56.4\]

**Interviewer:** [00:02:37.5] Where did you study biology?

**Rodrigo:** [00:02:48.7] Universidad de La Plata, Buenos Aires. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:02:53.6] What kind of biology? What interested you?

**Rodrigo:** [00:02:56.9] I research on fishes. Specifically on fish, but I also work in other conservationist projects as well. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:03:17.1] That explains the snorkelling.



**Interviewer:**  [00:03:38.0] You have to be quite brave to dare that over this side. Right? Because of the cold.

**Rodrigo:** [00:03:43.0] Yes. Well, it's more of a fright than the actual thing. You can be under water quite a long time. We can be up to an hour sometimes. It's cold anyway. But you can still enjoy it. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:03:58.4] What kind of fish are in these rivers?

**Rodrigo:** [00:04:06.9] Currently we can only find salmonids, exotic types: brown trout, rainbow trout, and Chinook salmon. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:04:20.8] Chinook!

**Rodrigo:** [00:04:34.2] The brown trout and rainbow trout were seeded a lot of years ago in all of Patagonia. And these populations have succeeded, and the Chinook salmon arrived by itself up to here. 

 [00:05:03.5] The Chinook salmon is produced in Chile in the Pacific Ocean. And due to a bad control of the breeding places they have began to colonize other systems in the Patagonian watershed. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:05:24.2] Are the populations healthy? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:05:33.1] Healthy in which sense? 

**Interviewer:** [00:05:38.7] In numbers.

**Rodrigo:** [00:05:41.1] Yes. They're stable. But naturally there were other species, native ones, that now are not there anymore. All the fishes you find today are exotic and they have displaced the native species. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:06:07.0] My wife is a landscaper, and she always comments on what is native. Does this generate some kind of problem in the difference between the flora and the fauna? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:06:17.2] Yes. Here the main problems relating to conservation of these natural systems are the exotic species, flora and fauna, and the bad control on the use of land. Be it for producing, which historically had been only about sheeps and cows, and now tourism is added. 

 [00:06:48.8] So they are like the different edges of a problematic situation to handle the system. There are a lot of species of exotic flora that are detrimental due to the fact that their reproductive system is very quick, and the same goes with the fishes. All of the invading exotic species, both flora and fauna, have that ability. To reproduce very fast. 

 [00:07:22.3] They have a wide range of commodities to grow in a site. To feed from something. So they spread really quick. And more so in these systems, which are very poor. And the native species grow so slowly here. 



**Rodrigo:**  [00:08:55.2] My partner arrived yesterday, and she told me that if you have time and interest: we are working with a system of reserves in town, urban reserves, which are of very quick access. If you want to visit any of these and she can tell you a bit about them, there's no problem. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:13:05.3] Do you visit the glacier? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:13:08.0] Yeah. I go when family comes over, or friends that haven't been to the area. Are you going or have gone already?

**Interviewer:**  [00:13:18.6] On Monday we're going. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:13:27.5] Are you doing mini trekking? Or by runway?

**Interviewer:**  [00:13:32.3] First boat, and then mini trekking. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:13:39.4] On that subject, we're still looking for kayaking, independent preferably, if he knows anyone ... 

**Rodrigo:** [00:14:18.8] Kayak La Leona? Did you speak with Kayak Santa Cruz? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:14:26.9] I found Kayak Santa Cruz, do you know them? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:14:30.0] Yes. I've got their phone. Eduardo's his name. Nice guy. Works with small groups in Calafate. So it's a good option. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:21:27.3] Can you film under rain? [Go pro can handle anything. Except for sound.]



**Rodrigo:** [00:23:02.4] Do you want to take some shots from the viewpoint?

**Interviewer:**  [00:23:09.1] Yeah. Sure. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:23:23.0] Later on it all goes away. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:24:47.8] That [house?] is amazing!



**Rodrigo:** [00:26:22.2] It's possible that the hill gets covered. Because there's a [wind?] coming from back there and perhaps it won't be visible in the whole day. It's a good opportunity to take shots right now. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:26:30.9] I was noticing the colour of the water. Is it possible that it got more clear? I saw more of a milky consistence the other day. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:26:35.7] Yes, it's possible. Also, depending on the lights, on the position of the sun, it changes a lot. But, if it has been raining a lot above, then the water gets dirtier, because it drags more sediment. If it's not been rainy then it stagnates and the sediments fall down. Well, not stagnated ... 

 [00:27:03.2] So the water has two things. The sediment which is soil, minerals that are in the water; and then the glacier has a sort of colloidal substance, which never decants, just like milk. When you pour a glass of milk you know it has water, but none of the components, such as fat, fall down. The particles remain in their own place. The glacier water has that, a lot of colloid. So that's what gives the milky colour. 

 [00:27:48.4] Also depending on the light you can see it differently, more green, or more light-blue. But this one is quite transparent. 

 [00:28:03.2] That seems to be snow. Because it's so cold... 

 [00:28:29.1] Did you here about the reserves? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:28:37.4] Yeah, I didn't translate because Phil understands everything. It's quite probable that we will. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:28:53.7] It's a volunteer work that is very good ... 

**Interviewer:** [00:28:58.0] We were actually looking for something like that. Today we are actually planning a visit to Los Huemules if we could go by on our way back. We'll check that out later if it fits. Perhaps having a talk with Evangelina could be more important. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:30:56.2] It's so awesome! I love the wind!

**Rodrigo:** [00:30:57.4] The mic fell. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:31:04.8] I like the wind. But I don't want to get sick. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:31:17.0] Como una playa tropical! [Laughters]

**Rodrigo:** [00:31:32.4] The air is very cold. 



**Interviewer:** [00:34:04.1] Do we have cell phone signal along the road?

**Rodrigo:** [00:34:04.1] No. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:34:06.3] Someone told us that sometimes at certain points you could get lucky. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:34:10.4] Well, in the last straight section of the road you can get some bit. Later on, as far as I know, you can't get any. Do you need to reach somebody? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:34:38.5] Not an essential thing.

**Rodrigo:** [00:34:40.4] You do have Lago del Desierto with a land line. 



**Interviewer:** [Discussing Evangelina. Great option!] [00:35:52.4] Seems good to reach Evangelina! Perhaps we can talk with her sitting at some place nearby us. 

**Rodrigo:** [00:36:20.4] Sure thing. Just let us know. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:36:43.7] Does she work in conservation? [Yes.] Genial!



**Interviewer:**  [00:38:37.0] Do you think that conservation and ecotourism are coexisting?

**Rodrigo:** [00:38:59.1] If they can or if it happens? 

**Interviewer:**  [00:39:04.2] All of that.

**Rodrigo:** [00:39:08.8] In Argentina in general everything happens quicker than what is possible to handle in a place. There's a lot of information, and a lot of sectors have the will so that tourism can be sustainable in conservation. But in truth, the economical projects move forward very quickly and endanger the places' sustainability.  

 [00:39:49.8] We are in a situation in which the places are taken care of only because they are so big and haven't received too much people, yet. But it is possible. We can only hope that over the years we can keep the place in good shape. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:40:22.3] When they ask about here, they are not only referring to the country, but rather here where you have to work. Perhaps it's all the same, but if there's anything else ... That's totally welcome. 

 [00:40:56.0] Is ecotourism just a concept or is it something practical for tourism? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:41:15.6] In a practical sense it would depend on each business, how they consider their own responsibility to the real ecotourism. That's my personal viewpoint. It is possible to undertake actions, concrete and direct ones on a certain topic. But in general it's a name that is more of publicity, or by marketing than a real thing.  

 [00:41:49.6] Because tourism is more massive than ecological. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:43:09.3] Around the world, Patagonia as a clothing brand has made this region very famous. Many people think of Patagonia as a dream Paradise with ecotourism. What are your thoughts on that? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:44:05.8] It fits quite tightly to reality because Patagonia as a brand sells natural things, such as this. We have great extensions of land or sea without many people. And I believe that it's the most attractive notion of the area. You can travel through roads where you don't cross any towns, where there are no visible activities. 

 [00:44:42.1] And that has a lot to do with the name or the brand that Patagonia has. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:45:33.4] So Patagonia the brand has been around on this region.. Has the brand created something around this location ... ? They sell adventure and clothing. 

 [00:47:33.7] I am trying to prepare the question, perhaps with an example outside of Patagonia.

[00:47:54.7] I can think of an example in Patagonia. The clothing company brands their clothes and everything to explore. That is the spirit of their clothes. Any outdoor company try to sell the idea of an adventure. This idea of wilderness. 

 [00:49:04.4] But is their any association about branding and place making? That's the tricky part for me.

 [00:49:25.0] Here's a simple question. Has the company done anything good for people, invested, contributed in the area here? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:50:24.6] I believe that they were very clever in adopting the word and the concept so that they can profit from it, and I'd say that there's a bit of a give and take situation. That it's been useful to both sides. 

 [00:50:55.7] To the area it's also useful to have the same name than a successful brand that is well known over the world and has a lot of matters of environmental responsibility and so that helps to strengthen the natural concept and of the region by itself. 

 [00:51:16.2] I think that it has been useful. 

[translating]



**Interviewer:**  [00:52:04.3] Would you refer to this area as Patagonia or Santa Cruz, or otherwise? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:52:16.9] Yes. Yes. Of course, clearly. But Patagonia is so extensive that sometimes it's a matter of confusion, from where does it begins and ends. At least in Argentina, when you speak about Patagonia, if the people are from the North, they'll think about Bariloche. When we talk with people from other parts of the world that come over to visit Southern Patagonia, they think more likely about Southern Patagonia, over Northern Patagonia. 

 [00:52:59.9] That's my understanding. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:53:16.0] Just to add up to the Argentinian meaning. To me, Patagonia is estancias, and nothing else. No tourism associated, for me in Patagonia. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:53:45.8] Most people in North America in general, I think would never think of Bariloche or even the sheep. They would think of Tierra del Fuego, the glaciers, the mountains. And perhaps mountains could include Bariloche too, but not as a town. More as of a picture, without details.

 [00:54:44.7] Also, it depends who you speak with, how they take advantage of the idea of Patagonia. For example, when we emailed, and I sent you a Netflix Special, that was on Francis Mallman. The guy has restaurants around the world, and he totally sold this idea that what he did was a Patagonian technique, and he has the Patagonia spirit. 

 [00:55:10.6] That is because he's been abroad and he knows what he's referring to. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:55:44.3] Do you have any notion of how the aboriginal populations were before colonization? 

**Rodrigo:** [00:55:51.4] Yes. The last aboriginal settlers were groups of people that followed food, and fed mainly by guanaco. They made everything with guanaco, they fed, clothed, made their houses, their tools for hunting. And they were more related to the steppe and with the limit of the forest, more than inside the forest. The forest wasn't very used by aboriginals. 

 [00:56:32.1] There are places that have been identified as used by these populations, they are more closely related to the steppe. 



 [00:56:54.1] I stopped because this area is interesting. They made it a as an historical reference site of an incident that happened in 1965, between Chile and Argentina that had a small war. Thanks to, or due to that confrontation, Argentina decides to establish Chaltén, as a town.

 [00:57:56.3] It's not something that we attend to much, but still... 

 [00:58:12.5] This is a recent commemoration. It wasn't actually made in this area. The conflict wasn't actually here. It was more inwards. There are versions that the confrontation wasn't very much as it's stated. Not as much of a frontier problem, but rather a personal argument between the carabineers (Chilean) and gendarmes (Argentinian). 

 [00:58:37.8] You know how history works. It's always told by those who take some advantage from it. 



**Interviewer:**  [00:59:59.2] The anniversary from this 1965 event was a commemoration that was made only recently with the plaque that dates from 2003. So it wasn't even a problem that happened exactly here but rather closer to the border. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:00:45.8] Here it states [reading] what shouldn't happen between two brother countries. 

 [01:01:27.7] [Translating: A Chilean carabineer was shot, and then assisted by an Argentinian but still died.] [Reading plaque. The Chilean had a risen flag, and then as a sign of respect the Argentinian flag was put back again.]



**Interviewer:**  [01:04:45.5] Amazing about Santiago de Chile was the museum to commemorate those disappeared during military regime. Probably the best "Museum" that I have ever seen. Right next to Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Memorial. 

 [01:05:32.8] And Buenos Aires, for a short visit, I loved it. It's a great, different kind of city, than most cities that I've ever met.



**Interviewer:**  [01:06:33.2] ¿Qué es esto?

**Rodrigo:** [01:06:33.2] A historical estancia center. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:07:40.5] What are the main environmental threats that the Park needs to deal with? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:07:55.9] One of the most menacing threats are natural. They are related to men, of course. Which are the interactions between the native species, of flora and fauna, and the exotic species that are entering ever more, and are modifying the place. As much as this happens all the time, in environments that species move around, and the environment reaches equilibrium, that is one of the threats.

 [01:08:31.4] Another menace is the use of land under no control, both be it by tourism, as by division of lots, and economic endeavours. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:08:55.9] Has tourism already grown out of control?

**Rodrigo:** [01:09:10.0] I don't think that it's out of control. Because there's nothing drastic yet happening. But there are times, short ones fortunately, in which there are a lot of people in certain places. And there's no control in relation to the amount of people. And when there's a lot of people, the largest menace is fire.

 [01:09:40.5] Being in the forest, us as humans, we have as a nice idea to start a fire, place a tent, sleeping in the mountain. But unfortunately, due to ignorance, more than malice, there are eventual situations in which people start fires in places that are extremely dangerous. 

 [01:10:11.1] I don't see an out of order situation yet in the area. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:10:33.8] The rain was coming from another valley. Fortunately it's not here. Yet. But it is getting cold. Right? The temperature is going down. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:10:58.9] Where there cattle here in the area? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:11:03.0] Yes. There still are cows. 

**Interviewer:** [01:11:36.2] He haven't seen. Except for the wild cows. Are these cows privately owned and managed? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:12:05.3] It depends on each countryside... They used to be only a few big fields. Then they started to get separated into lots, and become sub divided. But there was already a cattle production. And nowadays what we can find is that some fields have their animals and they handle them. And in other fields they stopped paying attention to the animals. So there are some area that have baguales.

 [01:12:31.8] They are sylvan cows. They are a problem for the area. Because they stomp. And it produces forests that don't get to have a good regeneration. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:12:46.4] Are they a plague?

**Rodrigo:** [01:12:46.4] Not yet. Because there's no uncontrolled amount but one animal alone in the forest ruins everything. Because they are very heavy, very big, they break everything. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:13:44.7] Do the rangers control this due to the harm they make? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:13:55.6] Not explicitly by National Parks nor, in this case the jurisdiction is of the province. It's a provincial reserve. They don't take it as a strict decision to kill them, but they do suggest, from the Forest Administration, that they should be removed or do something about the animals that hang loose. 

 [01:14:24.8] There's a waterfall here. Would you like to shoot? 



**Rodrigo:** [01:16:03.6] It doesn't have much water today. It's used to having more strength. Well, it has a lot of moss. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:19:37.5] They call this place the Jump of the Ring. This place has a story. I know one of them at least. I am not sure if it's real. It says that a man proposes to her girlfriend here and she answers no. And she takes the ring and throws it away. So there's a ring in the stream. Jump of the Ring. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:23:20.2] Over here there's an older forest, taller. 



**Interviewer:** [01:23:57.4] You've been here for three years, and you studied over in La Plata, but you're from Patagonia. More from the North? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:24:03.1] I've been 8 years here. I was born in Río Gallegos. And I studied in La Plata. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:24:27.5] How did you decide to move to Chaltén?

**Rodrigo:** [01:24:32.8] Because I've been coming since I was very little to travel, trips, vacations. And they offered me a job when I was still living in La Plata. And it was a professional job so I came over. The job that I had in La Plata was as a waiter. 

 [01:25:22.1] And I worked in the area of Environment, in Chaltén's Municipality. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:26:10.9] Was this road made in 1995? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:26:15.1] Yes. It was opened in 1995. 

 [01:26:36.5] This is an estancia. Río Toro. 

 [01:26:56.4] It used to belong to another estancia, and the family owners decided to convert this sector into a conservation area. They don't want it for cattle nor tourism nor anything. So among other decisions they decided to wire up a fence around the estancia, because they don't want any more cows inside their land. And what they did was to design a fence that would be friendly with the local fauna. 

 [01:27:32.0] That's why underneath it has that gap so that the little huemules, which are not so high, so that they can go through, and the adult huemules can jump over as well. 

**Interviewer:** [translating]

**Rodrigo:** [01:28:21.4] And the fence project, with the design and supervising over it, it was Evangelina and I who did that. It's not that we designed it, it's that there's several types of design and we chose this one. We consulted specialists on huemules. And that's a good example of the rancher [estanciero]. Because most of the estancias that make a fence, there are seven string wires, and with barb wire in the top. So that's super aggressive for the fauna, that can jump the fence. 

 [01:29:02.2] A lot of times they get entangled. Guanacos most of all. They get hooked and die in the fence. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:29:32.4] [translating]

**Rodrigo:** [01:29:43.5] And over here it's normal to see the hill but I think it's too cloudy now. Right? 

**Interviewer:**  [01:30:13.5] I think that's a guanaco. Could you tell us what a guanaco is? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:30:23.4] A guanaco is from the family of the camels, lamas. And it's originally from here, South America. And in Santa Cruz, in the steppe area they are very common, you can see them along the highway. They're sylvan. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:30:46.6] [translating] You can also use that same word to say that someone is tricky. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:31:12.2] Over this area already the river comes clean, and only ... The river is born in Lago del Desierto, which is very near, and it has already changed its colour. The water isn't milky anymore. It has no sediment. And it's transparent. This area is all used for fishing. It's an area of reproduction for the Chinook Salmonids. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:31:43.7] I'll shoot a bit. It's very clear water. What colour are guanacos? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:31:55.7] They are brown, and white. 

 [01:32:29.4] See. A guanaco. [showing]

 [01:33:07.0] Just another month more and this is a spectacle. Full of salmons. Do you know the Chinook Salmons? They're these creatures of this size. They're gigantic. People go crazy, you know? 

 [01:33:29.5] I go through the river in snorkel to make a recount of population and to look for spawning chambers. It's a lot of fun. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:33:38.8] And whatever they take from over here do they use them for gastronomy in the country? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:33:44.4]  No no. When the salmon arrives here the meat is very bad quality. Because it comes from the sea, which is 500 kilometres away, and since the moment that they access the river they don't eat at all. Doesn't feed anymore. They are like five months without eating, so they cannibalize, they auto consume, and once the spawn, they die. So it's almost rotten.

**Interviewer:**  [01:34:05.7] Once they spawn? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:34:07.7] They reproduce only once and die. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:34:20.9] So some reproduce and go back down the river?

**Rodrigo:** [01:34:22.3] No no. They come from the sea. Lay their eggs. And they die. The small fishes are born, live a short time in the river in fresh water, and begin to descend and reach the sea. They stay three or four years at sea, eating, and they come back up to reproduce themselves. And die. 

 [01:34:39.7] A life cycle that is very crazy. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:34:46.3] And once they spawn ...

**Rodrigo:** [01:34:49.9] Then they remain some time in the area, and they all begin to die. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:34:52.8] How many eggs can they lay? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:34:55.1] Thousands! That is depending on their weight. [Anyone could do that!] All for a screw! (Todo por un polvo!). The amount of eggs depends on the weight of the female. But well, less than 10% of the laid eggs are those that come back to the place later on. So the mortality rate is gigantic. 

 [01:35:29.1] It's quite cold!! 

 [01:35:35.4] That's snow up there. This kind of cold is coming from that snow up there. [showing]



**Interviewer:**  [01:36:31.5] With these lenses [circle/round polarizer] you can shoot all the fishes inside the water! I can see the fish as if there wasn't any water. Like they're floating in the air. But it has to be 90 degrees (to the sun). 

**Interviewer:**  [01:37:11.9] [translating to Rodrigo]

**Rodrigo:** [01:37:11.9] Wow. That's so nice! 

**Interviewer:**  [01:37:13.2] That's my fish filter. If you use the filter to one side you can only see the reflection of the water, and on the other side, you see no reflection at all, just what's underneath. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:38:13.8] Did you know that fishermen use polarized sunglasses? So that without the reflection you see them much better. When I'm working on that I use them. 



**Interviewer:** [01:38:41.6] Are they flamingos? 

**Rodrigo:** [01:38:41.6] Yes. Yes. The other day didn't we see some? No, we just commented about them. We saw the black neck swans. But we didn't see the flamingos. Now once we come back we'll check if we can find them in the lagoon. They're normally quite far away but with binoculars, sometimes we can get lucky. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:41:57.8] We're going to see a waterfall. El Salto Argentino [The Argentinian Jump.] [I'll put some more cover up on top. It's cold.]

 [01:43:43.4] This waterfall is the physical limit for the Chinook Salmon to reach the river. So they move no further from here. 

 [01:43:56.8] But there's no bear that eats them over here... 



**Interviewer:**  [01:45:24.5] Is that an orange over there?

**Rodrigo:** [01:45:24.5] Yeah. That's a piece a plastic. It's been there for a short time. The dirtiness... I have to come over with my suit and take it out. I have to go walking. The trick is that I have to come with someone else and take a safe rope. 



**Interviewer:**  [01:46:40.2] How do you ...

**Rodrigo:** [01:46:39.7] Reach over there? I just use a full body suit. The thing is that to reach up to that point, I have to walk, with my neoprene suit and a special set of fishing boots, to walk with a bit more comfort. It's not easy to walk over these places. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:46:59.0] Because of the moss...

**Rodrigo:** [01:46:59.0] Yeah, and a lot of rocks. The current throws you over. 

 [01:47:09.0] And if you get into the current you're going to get hurt. But you can get out quickly. And with the [frog legs?] in the river... You can do whatever you want. But you can get hurt all the same. 



**Rodrigo:** [01:49:25.1] Phil, you could bring a bear from Canada and place it there. So that they can eat the salmons.

**Interviewer:**  [01:55:44.1] Can this be a romantic go away? Or is it already worn out?

**Rodrigo:** [01:55:45.9] Yes! Of course! It's great. It's a nice place. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:55:52.9] In Córdoba you can go to the river but maybe that's not the vibe over here. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:55:57.8] No. People over here ... The road from up to the lake and the lake it's very used by people from town. More than the trails in the mountain. Because it's something that's more familiar. You can arrive by car, come down with your children. Or if the people are too old and can't walk, it's a good spot to come to. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:56:20.8] Like in Córdoba that you can come over in summer to take a bath. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:56:24.8] Well, not that much. 

**Interviewer:**  [01:56:30.0] But seriously speaking, if you do snorkel, perhaps those who are bold enough ... Perhaps I would have done it, but we didn't manage to form a group. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:56:37.0] Yeah sure. It's fun.

**Interviewer:**  [01:56:37.0] So there's people who does the snorkel, they brace up. 

**Rodrigo:** [01:56:40.4] Yes. Yes. Yes. I won't say that we go out everyday but we do have groups. Now we have reservations made for these days all the same. The matter is that there are splendid days like yesterday, that you can have a really great time. And other days, like today, or worse, when you have a good time but the situation is about what happens when you get out of the water. 

 [01:57:05.2] That's what makes the difference. Because if it's very hot, you take off the neoprene, and you can easily stay in the beach with a shirt on, and shorts. But in a day like this one, you take off the neoprene and you want to be covered with feathers, right on. But it's fun all the same. It's great. 

 [01:57:28.4] Having the chance to go underwater over here ... It's with a suit. When you have a very hot day over in town, we get into the river. All the neighbours, into the water without any suit. And the little kids are quite hardened. 

 [01:57:43.1] I can't swim without a suit. There are some kids that get into the water and swim for a short while. To me, the cold leaves me with no air. 



**Rodrigo:** [02:02:36.8] Did you see the waterfall? 

**Interviewer:**  [02:02:36.8] Yeah. Does that connect with this river? 

**Rodrigo:** [02:02:38.1] Yes! 

**Interviewer:**  [02:02:45.0] Beautiful! Have you been up there? 

**Rodrigo:**  [02:02:51.2] [not following, trying to speak in English] Other hills. The rocks are not good here. 

**Interviewer:**  [02:03:07.8] Soft! 

**Rodrigo:** [02:03:09.6] Yes! 



**Interviewer:**  [02:03:28.9] The leaves are so green. Like a lime green. 



**Rodrigo:** [02:03:50.6] Do you run? 

**Interviewer:**  [02:03:53.0] Sometimes. Why?

**Rodrigo:** [02:03:52.9] Because of the backpack. 

**Interviewer:**  [02:03:56.4] You?

**Rodrigo:** [02:03:56.4] Sometimes. I train a bit.
