**Interviewer:**  [00:00:22.0] When we were in Galapagos, we learned that Darwin's finches now love chips. They have reached a new stage in their adaptation: junk food. 

**Laura:** [00:07:08.9] [After saluting] That's a friend, who's mother of two, little kids. And this season she started to guide again. 

**Laura:** [00:08:36.1] So are you visiting other areas in Argentina? Or ...
**Interviewer:** [00:08:38.1] Only this area. But of course Buenos Aires, we have to go through it. We also thought about going to Tierra del Fuego too, but it was not enough time. 

**Interviewer:** [00:10:12.3] What are the impressions that visitors have of the mountains here? 
**Laura:** [00:10:19.0] In what sense?
**Interviewer:** [00:10:22.1] Do they feel that their expectations are met? 
**Laura:** [00:10:30.2] Yes! When visitors see the mountains here a lot of them, I've heard a lot of times, people that travel all over the world and they say: This is the best hiking day I ever had. Well, specially with good whether. When you can see the mountains. 
 [00:10:58.2] The whether is part of the environment here, of the landscape: we have glaciers, and we have these mountains with snow and glaciers and seracs, because of the whether conditions, so if we had sunny days everyday ... It's impossible to have the glaciers here, so sometimes the whether is not so good, but well, still the experience in general is always good. 

**Interviewer:** [00:11:33.3] We have learned just from first hand experience that not many people, or at least in Canada, have a clear idea of what Patagonia is like. Some people think that it's all mountains, it's all empty. 
**Laura:** [00:11:51.0] Yeah. In general people think that Patagonia, they're thinking the forest, the mountains, but this is just a very small part of the whole region. Patagonia, most of it, is like the way coming from Calafate. Very flat, very arid. And the forest and the mountains is just here. 
 [00:12:23.0] Even in Argentina if you say Patagonia, people think in the forest, the lakes. 
**Interviewer:**  [00:12:38.3] Even the estancias near the coast line. 
**Laura:** [00:12:38.3] Sure. The largest part of Patagonia is that: steep. But I think there are great things in this area. Like, have you seen Perito Moreno Glacier yet or not? 
**Interviewer:** [00:12:53.6] Not yet. By Monday. 
**Laura:** [00:12:55.3] OK. You'll be in front of a huge glacier, driving a car, stopping and from the parking you can see the glacier. That's something amazing. And well, here you have the town, you walk five minutes and you're in the middle of nature, no pollution. There are many places where you can go without crossing people. Very close. 
 [00:13:25.5] It's very pristine. You can drink the water from the mountains. 

**Interviewer:** [00:14:27.7] One of the things that we've found is that, compared to other parts in the world, that are just as beautiful, but the trails and the mountain area here, has not been developed. So often you're just ten minutes away, even in the mountains to a cold beer. Or an ice cream. 
**Laura:** [00:14:57.6] Right. Yes! Or a road. Lift. 

**Interviewer:** [00:15:08.9] Are the people who would like this would be like that? 
**Laura:** [00:15:14.8] Well, actually people in town in the last weeks was very concerned because there's a project in most of the National Parks to develop the activity, to develop tourism, and to give concessions for hotels in different natural areas. Maybe in some parts it's great because you need more development but here, next to the town is not necessary. 
 [00:15:53.3] Still, the National Park Administration is ... The idea is to keep nature. And to keep pristine areas. So I hope it remains like that. 

**Laura:** [00:20:22.6] Have you seen these little fruits before? It's chaura. It's eatable. Like a little apple. Maybe not as good as your croissant, but ... 
**Interviewer:** [00:20:42.3] Is that a Calafate berry? 
**Laura:** [00:20:43.4] No. That's chaura. Not so tasty. 

**Interviewer:** [00:22:32.2] You said most of the visitors are from Argentina, North America and Europe. Have you seen any changes in the number of people coming from China? 
**Laura:** [00:22:48.0] Yeah. In Chaltén we get many Japanese groups. They like trekking a lot. They go camping, some of them. And in the last years I've seen more Chinese. I know there's a lot of Chinese that go to Calafate, more to the car easy tours. But in the last years I've seen more trekking groups. 
 [00:23:19.6] Chinese, Koreans. 
**Interviewer:** [00:23:25.6] The places that we go to have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of Chinese tourists over the last few years. And some places, changing the local economy, and the form of touristic activities available. Given what I know it makes sense that there are more in Calafate. 
**Laura:** [00:23:58.1] Yeah. Of course to come here is for trekking so I saw many groups that are not prepared for trekking and they just go to the regular tours to see the balconies at Perito Moreno Glacier from there. The boat tours around Perito Moreno Glacier and the other glaciers. 

**Interviewer:** [00:26:09.9] Do you have to be a local in order to be able to guide a group?
**Laura:** [00:26:13.1] In the National Park there are different categories to guide different activities. Tourism guide for some of the very short guides, and the Perito Moreno Glacier for example. I mean the balconies. Mountain guide or trekking guide for these hikes. And to go to the glaciers. And high mountain guide, the international certification, to go climbing for example, or skiing. 
 [00:26:47.3] And each National Park, well, you have to take an exam to be able to guide in that National Park. You have to take an exam about well flora, fauna, the trails, names. Then once you take the exam then you have to pay every year for that certification for the permission. But there are guides from all over the country guiding here. 
**Interviewer:** [00:27:22.1] But not from outside the country.
**Laura:** [00:27:24.0] Well, to work like working in other countries is the same: you need to be Argentinian or at least with a residence to be legally working. Otherwise you are working illegally if you're not from that place. 
**Interviewer:** [00:27:42.6] Let's say a group of Americans brings their own guide from Colorado. 
**Laura:** [00:27:49.3] The guide from Colorado can't work in Argentina without the working visa. Or the residence in Argentina. It's not the trekking or the mountain part it's the legal part of working in the country. 
**Interviewer:** [00:28:16.6] Something tells me that you're not surprised. 
**Interviewer:**  [00:28:20.7] It's not that. Whenever we go to places that are so international, I'm always interested in where the money goes and where it stays. And so, if a group of American tourists arrive for the day in Calafate and bring their own tour guide, and then they go back home, there isn't a single cent that remains here, right? 
**Laura:** [00:29:02.6] Yeah. 

**Interviewer:** [00:29:06.0] As far as the guiding goes it doesn't happen.
**Laura:** [00:29:08.7] Yes. That happened the first years that the tourists from Calafate started to come here by bus, just for the day. So the tourists were just coming for the day maybe stopping, eating something in the restaurant, and then returning to Calafate. And a lot of people from the town was like upset with that kind of tourism but I think that is the way to, well, know the place! 
 [00:29:38.8] Many people came for the first time like that. And said: Oh, Chaltén is a good place to come and stay more days here. So then they came again. And stayed here in Chaltén. Because sometimes when you buy the tour they offer Calafate and not Chaltén. So people stay in Calafate for four or five days and they came just for the day. And then they say: ah, there are hotels here; it's a good place to stay. 
 [00:30:06.1] And maybe, specially Argentinians, maybe then they come again and stay in Chaltén more days than in Calafate. 

**Laura:** [00:31:30.2] Are you seeing all the holes from the woodpeckers? The woodpeckers looking for the worms inside the trees, inside the bark. 
**Interviewer:** [00:31:47.7] We have a [x] woodpecker at home that during mating season, or at least this is the dominant explanation, no one has the real science: the males like to peck to make noise and so they find a noise means [Houses!] roofs, all sort of things that are incredibly loud. 
**Laura:** [00:32:28.0] That can be the explanation, because there are no worms there. Why are they pecking? 
**Interviewer:** [00:32:34.1] They're just doing it to show off. It sounds like a machine gun. Like they find something metal. 
**Laura:** [00:32:45.9] Do you live in a city or in a natural ...? 
**Interviewer:** [00:32:50.8] We live in a small island. So we have ten acres of land and so we are essentially living in rain forest. It's really quite. So when the woodpecker does that it really shakes you to your feet. Suddenly you go from absolute quiet to a machine gun. 
**Laura:** [00:33:21.1] That can be scary if you don't know that it can happen. 

**Interviewer:** [00:33:55.4] Have you trekked, hiked in the rest of the world?
**Laura:** [00:33:56.6] Yeah. Well, in other parts of the country. In Mendoza, in Córdoba, there are nice mountains. In Tierra del Fuego. And well, I went once to Bolivia. I did some climbing there. Some mountain climbing. Perú as well. Spain. Canada must be nice.
**Interviewer:** [00:34:42.0] It's different. I often find it less approachable. It's such a big country, so underpopulated. With little time and there are not many trails. The ones that exist can be very solitary. And so we need to be prepared for serious dangerous wild life. 
**Laura:** [00:35:35.2] I was going to show you the leaves you asked. The lenga and ñire. The difference. [showing] The lenga's leave is very regular, vein and curves. It's like a heart. And this one is the ñire. Very similar but very [sharp?] on the side. Both change colors in autumn and then they fall.
[00:36:12.4] And normally the lenga can grow very tall and straight and the ñire is more like that one, lower and normally at the bottom of the valley. The lenga is the one that grows up to the timberline. And up there it grows like a bonzai, very low.

**Laura:** [00:40:45.0] I don't go very often to cities. But I realize that in cities people don't look up. They just look down, cell phone, they don't care what's happening around. 
**Interviewer:** [00:41:03.3] Have you found that people are more immersed into their phones?
**Laura:** [00:41:18.7] Well. Yeah, in a way, with the pictures. But there's no connection here. So ... That makes it ... Much better. But in front of Perito Moreno there's cell phone signal, so I'm sure you'll see a lot of people with cell phones in their hands, or talking. I'm very happy that there's no cell phone signal. Only in some points and in some summits in the mountains.
 [00:41:50.3] But actually it's very good. Because it's safe here, to be able to call from the cell phone. But that's great. Yeah, you see people listening to music, some people with high [loud] music. But it's nice that you're outside of the ... [Unplugged.] Yeah.

**Laura:** [00:43:14.0] And the cell phone thing is something new in town. I think we had for the first time like 6, 7 years ago, cell phone signal in town. 
**Interviewer:** [00:43:25.6] Has it changed life in town?
**Laura:** [00:43:27.8] In many ways. Yeah. Well, communication is very important. And it can be very useful for many things. To communicate with your family, to be in touch with friends, makes things easier in many ways. So, that's the good side. Many years ago it was very common to have in all houses
 [00:43:59.4] the paper and the pen next to the door. Because here it's not like in the cities that you have week and weekend and people is busy during the week and is free on weekends. Here maybe you go for a dinner with friends on Monday and maybe you're working on Sunday. So it's very common to meet your friends any day. Just go and visit them. Now with a cell phone you ask first if they're at home. 
 [00:44:34.7] A few years ago it was just going, knocking on the door. 
**Interviewer:** [00:44:38.4] I imagine that the arrival of internet must have changed tourism ... 
**Laura:** [00:44:46.7] Yeah. For sure. Well, now all the reservations are going through the internet. You have all the websites to book hotels and to know about the place, to investigate. You don't need to go to a travel agency, to ask for all the information there. You can do it from your home.  

**Laura:** [00:45:44.5] But it's funny to see some people that they want to be in a very remote area but they want to have very fast internet. There are some contradictions. People say: oh, there's a lot of people on these trails. Well, we are well known over the world. It's one of the best places for trekking in the world. 

**Laura:** [00:49:29.0] I like to be able to reach my daughter in town. 

**Laura:** [00:49:58.5] There was a project many many years ago to build a dam for electricity, a little one. For the electricity of the town. Like 15 or more years ago. It was a much smaller town. But the project, I don't know why, didn't continue. And well, that's part of the dam they were going to build. 
**Laura:** [00:50:32.8] It's not connected, the electricity. It's coming from an engine, a fuel engine generator. Yes.

**Interviewer:** [00:50:54.8] Has sewage waste been a problem?
**Laura:** [00:50:59.7] Yes. It's a problem. Because the people from the town is very concerned about that. So we don't want garbage around, plastic bags everywhere. And a lot of people from the town agreed on recycling part of the garbage that is possible to recycle of course. So the town is always working on that.
 [00:51:30.1] It's difficult because we are far away from all the places where they get the garbage to recycle. But well, a lot of people, at their houses, it's not compulsory but most of the people, at their houses, throw the compost in the garden. The organic part. And we separate the plastic, the glass, and paper. And we take it to the place in town where they take it by truck. 
 [00:52:06.6] Then the rest of the garbage is going to a place just a few kilometres from here but it's thrown with no classification or anything there. 

**Laura:** [00:52:26.2] That means that we are getting to the town. The windy valley. 

**Interviewer:**  [00:52:43.5] And what about the pipeline from the sewers?
**Laura:** [00:52:46.9] I don't know how it's called. The system. Sewers. Yeah. All the fluids are going finally to the river. So the treatment sometimes is not enough. And the problem in town is that it's collapsed. Because the town grew so fast that all the infrastructure is not enough now.
 [00:53:35.3] It was built a few years ago. But with not such a big increase of the population and the touristic buildings and the hotels. So in summer, once in a while we have problems. The idea of the project is to take 
 [00:54:02.1] the gas, the generator, outside of the town. There's an idea with the National Park to take some land from the National Park to pass all the services there. But well, yeah, now, in summer specially it's a problem because the town is collapsed. 

**Interviewer:** [00:56:24.4] Now we're going to ask for you to respond in Spanish.
 [00:57:25.0] Is this a wilderness in your opinion?
**Laura:** [00:57:31.2] Yes. This is a remote area in many senses. Considering in first place the whether. It's very changing, all the time. You have to be prepared for all possible conditions. We are used to saying that you can have all seasons in a single day. It can change very quickly. Nature, as we've seen along the day is very SALVAJE [savage, wild], very natural.  
 [00:58:04.4] There are very few modifications, and the little that you can see is what we see along the way, some signing, some few camping areas that the National Park allows. So yes, I believe that this is an area very remote. 
**Interviewer:** [00:58:22.4] So, if I asked you what does wild mean to you, what would you say, what is wild? You can explain between the languages if you find similarities or differences if needed. 
**Laura:** [00:58:47.8] Let me think about it. 
 [00:58:57.8] [In English] Well yes. I think wild is ... Patagonia is wild. [Goes on in Spanish] This place has a lot of virgin nature. Very ample places to go through. You can choose what kind of adventure you want, and the experience that you want to have. I think it's open to a lot of possibilities. 
**Interviewer:** [00:59:29.5] The word wild in English, and the word salvaje in Spanish. Do you think they mean the same or different? [Responds in English]
**Laura:** [00:59:50.0] Well I like actually more wild than salvaje. Salvaje I think in Spanish there are like some bad or not so nice things about that word in Spanish: salvaje. So I like wild. 
**Interviewer:** [01:00:08.6] What are these things? 
**Laura:** [01:00:12.1] Salvaje it can be the way that it's like not so good culturally. Yeah, not so controlled for example. 
**Interviewer:** [01:00:33.1] What do you find of positive in the English word, wild? 
**Laura:** [01:00:41.2] I relate more wild with nature things. With nature, with wild life, wild animals. Maybe I have only part of the concept and I am missing part of the concept you have in your language. 
**Interviewer:**  [01:01:03.5] It's OK. We're interested in your opinion. Salvaje perhaps is close to savage. Which is similar. 
**Laura:** [01:01:25.2] I think in Chaltén, people living here must be wild in a way. You have to be able to adapt to different things in town. Being a small town, not so many things, not so many options. Talking about options of food, of buildings, the way we live, the activities that we have. This is my job. This is my dress for working. So you need to be a bit wild to live in town. 
**Interviewer:** [01:02:01.3] So this place is inscribed by UNESCO World Heritage for it's natural characteristics, natural heritage. Is their cultural heritage here? 
**Laura:** [01:02:13.6] Well. The culture in Chaltén, or in Calafate as well, I think is a mixture of the culture from Argentina. Because people that is living here, we are all coming from other parts of the country. So, culturally speaking I think it's a mixture, but we all share the passion for the mountains and for nature. I think that's the only way to survive in this wild place. 
**Interviewer:** [01:02:46.4] So a sign like this, does that take away from it's wildness? 
**Laura:** [01:02:52.9] Well yeah. In a way there are some things in the Park that the first time that you see those things it's like a bit shocking. But I think it's necessary. I think it's important to find the balance because it's a wild place but people from all over the world, we are talking about thousands of tourists coming so you need rules. And you need to control it. You need to mark trails. Otherwise the erosion and people camping and doing whatever they think is good doesn't work very well.
 [01:03:31.3] So, I think it's part of that balance that we have to find. 

**Laura:** [01:04:02.6] Thinking about wild things. My address in my ID, my first in Chaltén from 2006 is a campsite number. So my ... [people ask for directions] That's why you need signs. 
 [01:04:43.2] So my ID is Campamento Madsen #26. That's wild. Once I had to present my ID and the girl was asking address and she thought that I was on a street. And she asked for a floor. No no, no floor. Just on the floor. 
**Interviewer:** [01:05:14.2] So you lived in Camp Madsen. [Yeah] Please tell us what it was like. 
**Laura:** [01:05:20.1] Well, those were the more wild years of the town. Many years ago there was an area called Campamento Madsen, where a lot of people that came for the summer to work, we were all living in that area, just with a tent, with a place for the stove, maybe some benches to sit.
 [01:05:48.4] It was next to the town and most of the guides were living there. So to find a guide the agencies were going to the camp site and asking for the guides there. Climbers staying there in that free camping area. And well, that was one of the things that disappeared with all the growth of the town.  
 [01:06:16.7] And the controls from the National Park. Because the NP said: No, OK, this is not good, a lot of people are living there, no restrooms, no infrastructure, and they said that it was not allowed anymore. Wild years.

**Laura:** [01:09:43.9] I couldn't stop thinking in the netflix series Wild Wild Country. The story of Osho. My mom used to have books by him, well, everything he says is very nice and all. But the whole story how they leave India to search for a place in USA, where they could make a totally isolated community, with their own rules, and all their way of life.
 [01:10:34.5] But of course, next to a small town in USA, Antelope, I don't recall the region. And all the friction with the locals, with government, it all goes out of control. Osho ends leaving in a plane so that they don't put him in jail. 
**Interviewer:** [01:11:21.7] Sloterdijk is a reknown philosopher that has been proclaimed one of his disciples, he wrote a trilogy on nature called Spheres: bubbles, foams, and another one. The first about relationship in the maternal womb, and about relationships formed as dyads. 
 [01:12:16.2] Third sphere is about man and environment. A savage reading, a very long text. But if Osho is interesting that's a nice pointer. 

**Laura:** [01:13:00.0] In the documentary it's not focused on what they profess, but on what happened. They even accused them of having poisoned the whole town. They had guns. 

**Interviewer:** [01:13:39.1] A little bit like the bad meaning of wild. As in wild west. 
**Laura:** [01:13:41.1] Yes!

**Laura:** [01:16:50.6] This soccer field is not very popular. We have an indoor gym. Near the school. And kids can practice hockey, basket, soccer. Even today that you see that it's a wonderful day but it's windy. To sit down with a baby and to say: let's go for a picnic; we can't do that many days in summer. 

**Laura:** [01:18:35.3] You can see a lot of types of buildings. That house there, ready to move it. Here you see a container. The green one is a container. You have this dome here. That's going to be a house. They still have to put the windows. 

**Laura:** [01:19:09.9] This is the house of the guy that makes those domes. He makes them to sell them. So his house is a dome. 
**Interviewer:** [01:19:31.1] Do they have separations inside?
**Laura:** [01:19:31.1] Yes. 

**Interviewer:** [01:20:33.3] Are there people living in those as well?
**Laura:** [01:20:35.9] I think they are building them but yes, they will. It's so expensive and so difficult to build here that they use all the alternatives. 

**Laura:** [01:21:24.0] So that's a typical shape of cloud, that's called a lenticular cloud. Like lentils. 

**Interviewer:** [01:22:12.2] Does the season suddenly begin one day and then another suddenly finish?
**Laura:** [01:22:13.6] Well, the season is extending a little more each year, and those who are coming a lot are the photographers. In April, which used to be a dead month, now in autumn the photographers are coming a lot. In that world, a place becomes popular, in vogue, and now Patagonia is a trend. And the autumn is very nice, the leaves change colours, the days are shorter. They like to shoot at sunrise and sunset, and the days are much shorter. So in April there's plenty of photographers. But later on, in May, June, you could walk the entire day and see 10 people, at the most. 
**Interviewer:** [01:22:56.5] Could you say that in winter there's zero people?
**Laura:** [01:22:58.9] I'm not sure if I could go as far as that. But very few people. All the hotels close. There's just one or two left open. And the restaurants the same. In July, which is the winter vacations for the school children, everyone leaves away. 
 [01:23:22.5] Nowadays people are staying more permanently, and there's more activity in the Casa de la Cultura, they do activities. The climbing wall of the Andean Club [Club Andino] is crammed. Because everyone is there, climbing. There's a movement of going to ski, for the people that live here, the locals, the mountain guides that are experienced in ski, and they take the chance to go to ski. 
 [01:23:55.6] It's very calm. 
**Interviewer:** [01:24:01.5] Do they ski here?
**Laura:** [01:24:01.5] Yeah. They have to climb, walking, with your skis. And then the snow conditions ... You don't know what you're going to stumble upon. You have to know how to ski very well. You need to rely on the whole rescue team: the shovel and all that in case there's an avalanche and that you can come out of the situation with your team mates. 
**Interviewer:** [01:24:30.1] Does Northern ski exist over here?
**Laura:** [01:24:32.8] It's not popular, in Argentina. And here I'm not sure there's anyone that does that, or if the have the equipment. 
 [01:24:54.5] Perhaps in Ushuaia there's much more snow. It's more humid. Here it's not humid, so when it rains it's not much. In Ushuaia the mountains are low so you can access. It has a ski centre. 
 [01:25:19.2] Over here you have to move far away to find snow. 

**Interviewer:** [01:25:36.5] Pipa handed us over there because we had little time. This side is too easy he said, just to start. And then we would joke about this side being easy. It was hard on the other side!

**Interviewer:** [01:26:40.9] Is that another entrance? 
**Laura:** [01:26:41.5] Yeah, that's right. It's closed street. Not private. We could have used that road. It should be a public road. There's my daughter! Amalia.
