 This package implements the tools of the screenplay document class
 in the form of a package so that screenplay fragments can be included
 within another document class.  For full documentation of the available commands,
 please consult the screenplay class documentation.

 All commands related to the titlepage in screenplay.cls have been
 eliminated.

 One new environment is implemented:

    \begin{screenplay} ... \end{screenplay} 

 Two additional user commands are added to allow for user adjustment of the
 fragment font and linespacing (the setspace package is used for spacing).
 American spellings of the centring commands are also added.

    \screenspacing{} % sets the linespacing for screenplay fragments; default
                       is \onehalfspacing
    \screenfont{}    % sets the font for screenplay fragments; default is
                       \ttfamily
