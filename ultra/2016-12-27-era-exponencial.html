<h2>Bienvenidos a la era exponencial</h2>
<h4>jota al cubo mandó por cel <a href="http://www.rhmanagement.cl/rhm/silicon-valley/">una nota</a> sobre la singularidad, el crecimiento, el trabajo, y la utilidad del humano medio</h4> <!-- 22 julio, 2016 / 1946 likes -->
<h6>Tras asistir a un encuentro de la <a href="https://su.org/">Singularity University</a>, el alemán <em>Udo Gollub</em> escribió un artículo en su Facebook con los conceptos claves que aprendió. En él describe las innovaciones más importantes de los próximos años, revelando la magnitud de la transformación que se avecina en el planeta. (* No entendí por qué no aparece el <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-future-look-like-udo-gollub">post del autor</a> directamente ... Bueno saco de ahí ya que está en inglés.)</h6>

<p><em>Digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law. So as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, before it became way superiour and got mainstream in only a few short years. It will now happen with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><mark>Autonomous cars</mark>: In 2018 the first self driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. <strong>You don't want to own a car anymore</strong>. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will never get a driver's licence and will never own a car. <mark>It will change the cities</mark>, because <strong>we will need 90-95% less cars</strong> for that. <strong>We can transform former parking space into parks</strong>. 1,2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 100,000km, with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 10 million km. That will <mark>save a million lifes</mark> each year.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can only now see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. [...] With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter. We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Health: The Tricorder X price will be announced this year. There will be companies who will build a medical device (called the &quot;Tricorder&quot; from Star Trek) that works with you phone, which takes your retina scan, you blood sample and you breath into it. It then analyses <mark>54 biomarkers</mark> that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medicine, nearly for free.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from 18,000$ to 400$ within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All major <mark>shoe companies started 3D printing shoes</mark>. Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large amout of spare parts they used to have in the past. At the end of this year, new smartphones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home. In China, they already 3D printed a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agriculture: There will be a 100$ agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countried can then become managers of their field instead of working all days on their fields. Aeroponics will need much less water. The first petri dish produced veal is now available and will be cheaper than cow produced veal in 2018. <em>Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows</em>. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. <strong>There are several startups who will bring <mark>insect protein</mark> to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat</strong>. It will be labeled as &quot;alternative protein source&quot; (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is an <mark>app called &quot;moodies&quot;</mark> which can already tell in which mood you are. [...] Bitcoin will become mainstream this year and might even become the default reserve currency. [mmm.....]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more that one year increase per year. So we all might <mark>live for a long long time</mark>, probably way more than 100.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Education: The cheapest smartphones are already at 10$ in Africa and Asia. Until 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smartphone. That means, everyone has the same access to world class education. Every child can use <strong>Khan academy</strong> for everything a child learns at school in First World countries. </em></p>
