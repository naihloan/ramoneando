## Today trained with Dante Ducret

- What is the need of vitamin D?
- Kosak March (generating the springing of the feet). very alike to Romanov's Method. Good

## Observation on Almond Trees

I saw this in Tanti, CÃ³rdoba. In October, already Spring, most frosts have already passed.  But some come late. This can become a problem: because if the Almond Trees think that no more frosts are coming... they blossom! But the early blossom can die if a late Frost falls. 

So some people hit the trees with a cane so that they stress and don't blossom early. Is this anti-vegan? Well, they don't have a nervous system. But it still seems Specism. Compare to Wheatopocene and Matrix Crops.

## Watching Earthlings

	- humaine euthanasia involves uthasal. If not, gas chamber (for low cost budget)
