### Urban inscription is not only about counter-culture; new voices spread through a whole country
#### The case of *Yellow Stars* as a legalized protest against deadly traffic accidents in Argentina
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This presentation focuses on a specific type of urban intervention:
the painting of Yellow Stars in highways along the whole of Argentina,
wherever a mortal car accident has occurred. In the year 2008, a civil
association began to protest in this specific way against how people
drive in Argentina and painting under this cause became legalized.

The aim of attending to this case is to present a form of expression
that is spreading, one that represents not a subculture but a larger
social group: occupying the streets to claim a political or social debt
from society, and that unifies the whole country under a single flag. 
Between 2008 and 2017, over 10500 Stars have been painted all over
Argentina.

In the past 40 years, graffiti has been associated to a myriad of themes,
most of them counter-cultural, at least in their beginnings. The main
topics graffiti goes around include art, street culture, political
protest and even anarchism. However, lately graffiti has
become so ubiquitous that it causes a certain normalizing effect: the
public already acknowledges that graffiti exists, and that it points
city dwellers in a certain direction: creating different
types of subcultures and counter-cultural movements.

Urban signage on the other hand, has in general been controlled by the
state. The social innovation in this case is how citizens take hands in
the matter to literally change what freeways and streets look like. Each
time a driver or a passer-by goes past a non-state "Yellow Star" he, or she,
may act differently than if there were no signage at all. The presence
of painted "Yellow Stars" is a public's claim for order, in an orderless 
environment. Hence, it is an urban intervention --a graffiti-- that
goes beyond the classical political contents against specific government
administrations, beyond art, and occupies the streets to defend an idea
for a different society, with fewer deaths by car "accidents".

Urban inscriptions can impulse social change, adaptation, new ways
of driving and walking on a large scale as well.
