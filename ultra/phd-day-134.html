<p><strong>Hypothesis Mission</strong></p>
<p>The Hypothesis Project is a new effort to implement an old idea: A conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site.</p>
<p><a href="/team/">Our team</a> creates <a href="/developers/">open source software</a>, pushes for standards, and fosters community.</p>
<p>Using annotation, we enable sentence-level note taking or critique on top of news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. Everything we build is guided by <a href="/principles/">our principles</a>. In particular that it be <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a>, open, non-profit, neutral and lasting to name a few.</p>
<p><a href="https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf">We are a non-profit organization</a>, funded through the generosity of <a href="/sponsors/">sponsors</a> like the Knight, Mellon, Shuttleworth, Sloan, Helmsley, and Omidyar Foundations‚Äîand through the support of thousands of individuals like yourself that want to see this idea come to fruition. You can <a href="/donate">donate to our effort</a>, or <a href="/financial-information/">view our tax returns</a>.</p>
<p>Our efforts are based on the annotation standards for digital documents developed by the <a href="http://w3.org/annotation">W3C Web Annotation Working Group</a>. We are partnering broadly with developers, publishers, academic institutions, researchers, and individuals to <a href="/developers/">develop a platform</a> for the next generation of read-write web applications. You can follow our development progress on our <a href="https://trello.com/b/2ajZ2dWe/public-roadmap">roadmap</a>. Many have contributed <a href="/tools-plug-ins-and-integrations/">tools, plug-ins and integrations</a>.</p>
