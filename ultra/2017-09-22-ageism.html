<!-- <p>What's one thing that every person in this room is going to become? Older. And most of us are scared stiff at the prospect. How does that word make you feel? I used to feel the same way. What was I most worried about? Ending up drooling in some grim institutional hallway. And then I learned that only four percent of older Americans are living in nursing homes, and the percentage is dropping. What else was I worried about? Dementia. Turns out that most of us can think just fine to the end. Dementia rates are dropping, too. The real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss. I also figured that old people were depressed because they were old and they were going to die soon.</p> -->

It's called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been borne out by dozens of studies around the world. You don't have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire. The curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain. So I started feeling a lot better about getting older, and I started obsessing about why so few people know these things. The reason is ageism: discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age. We experience it anytime someone assumes we're too old for something, instead of finding out who we are and what we're capable of, or too young. Ageism cuts both ways.</h5>
<!-- <p>All -isms are socially constructed ideas — racism, sexism, homophobia — and that means we make them up, and they can change over time. All these prejudices pit us against each other to maintain the status quo, like auto workers in the US competing against auto workers in Mexico instead of organizing for better wages. We know it's not OK to allocate resources by race or by sex. Why should it be OK to weigh the needs of the young against the old?</p> -->
<!-- <p>All prejudice relies on &quot;othering&quot; — seeing a group of people as other than ourselves: other race, other religion, other nationality.</p> -->

It's denial when we try to pass for younger or when we believe in anti-aging products, or when we feel like our bodies are betraying us, simply because they are changing.</h4>
<!-- <p>Why on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow as we move through life?</p> -->
<h5 id="why-should-aging-well-mean-struggling-to-look-and-move-like-younger-versions-of-ourselves">Why should aging well mean struggling to look and move like younger versions of ourselves?</h5>
<!-- <p>It's embarrassing to be called out as older until we quit being embarrassed about it, and it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures. The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial, the better off we are.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are always a mistake, of course, but especially when it comes to age, because the longer we live, the more different from one another we become. Right? Think about it. And yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home as the same age: old — when they can span four decades.</p> 
<p>Can you imagine thinking that way about a group of people between the ages of 20 and 60? When you get to a party, do you head for people your own age? Have you ever grumbled about entitled millennials? Have you ever rejected a haircut or a relationship or an outing because it's not age-appropriate? For adults, there's no such thing. All these behaviors are ageist. We all do them, and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.</p> 
<p>Nobody's born ageist, but it starts at early childhood, around the same time attitudes towards race and gender start to form, because negative messages about late life bombard us from the media and popular culture at every turn.Right? Wrinkles are ugly. Old people are pathetic. It's sad to be old.</p> 
<p>Look at Hollywood. A survey of recent Best Picture nominations found that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters were age 60 and up, and many of them were portrayed as impaired. Older people can be the most ageist of all, because we've had a lifetime to internalize these messages and we've never thought to challenge them. I had to acknowledge it and stop colluding.</p> 
<p>&quot;Senior moment&quot; quips, for example: I stopped making them when it dawned on me that when I lost the car keys in high school, I didn't call it a &quot;junior moment.&quot; We are all worried about some aspect of getting older, whether running out of money, getting sick, ending up alone, and those fears are legitimate and real.</p> 
<p>But what never dawns on most of us is that</p> -->

<!-- <p>When labels are hard to read or there's no handrail or we can't open the damn jar, we blame ourselves, our failure to age successfully, instead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful and the discrimination that makes those barriers acceptable.</p> -->

And just like race and sex, age is a criterion for diversity. A growing body of fascinating research shows that attitudes towards aging affect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level. When we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly) or call them &quot;sweetie&quot; or &quot;young lady&quot; — it's called elderspeak — they appear to instantly age, walking and talking less competently. People with more positive feelings towards aging walk faster, they do better on memory tests, they heal quicker, and they live longer.</h5>
<!-- <p>Even with brains full of plaques and tangles, some people stayed sharp to the end. What did they have in common? A sense of purpose. And what's the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life? A culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage. That's why the World Health Organization is developing a global anti-ageism initiative to extend not just life span but health span. Women experience the double whammy of ageism and sexism, so we experience aging differently.</p> -->

<!-- <p>Why add another -ism to the list when so many, racism in particular, call out for action? Here's the thing: we don't have to choose. When we make the world a better place to grow old in, we make it a better place in which to be from somewhere else, to have a disability, to be queer, to be non-rich, to be non-white. And when we show up at all ages for whatever cause matters most to us —save the whales, save the democracy — we not only make that effort more effective, we dismantle ageism in the process.</p> -->
