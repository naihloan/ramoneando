<li>While running I notice to my side, at the level of the pool park, there is a slack liner on top of a very unusually long stretch of thread. the balance of the thread is very unstable and the person on top is shifting his feet and arms from one side to another on purpose, which makes believe that he is very skilled. I notice this just by passing by, another tribe of people that participate in these public hobbies. It took very little time, I might have been away in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqCpjFMvz-k">7 seconds</a>?</li>
<li>the other day, running through the boulevard of El Dante, I almost get hit in my head in the dark by a branch of the thick size of my fist. near/ahead of the restaurant ... in the street way before Choris El Dante. Today there was another branch in the floor in a nearby place. It was not higher than my shins, and I didn't hit it or stumble, but still, you need skill in this obstacle course.</li>
<li>mucus is always inside there, even if we forget. today I was trying to run fast to keep temperature high since it was cold. and even so I had a bit of mucus running. my solution, learned from my dad: close one nostril and spit out from the other to the floor. mess: sometimes not all comes out and some remains hanging. this is how I deal with body fluids in public. and seems normal, is it?</li>
<li>invisible people seem to be talking in the darkness today. when going through the back door of the zoo at Rondeau Street I hear that someone is talking. alone or a larger party I don't know. I can't see people because they are over a slump of over 7 meters distance above, and there are many trees and bushes. most likely they are homeless and/or drunkards. a far chance could be teenagers, but unlikely.</li>
<li>sometimes I descend from sidewalk to street level because it's more even: idiots in bike take short corners at curves and pass very close to me. which irritates me. ... another guy coming towards me runs with a dog: the owner carries him with a leash and I only notice this when I am very close... I almost get in the middle of the two bodies but there was no accident luckily. that irritated my very much. am I in a bad mood? don't think so. perhaps I am wrong.</li>
