<blockquote>
<p>NIKI: <em>Twenty-five drivers start every season in Formula 1, and each year two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers. People who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying. My name is Niki Lauda, and racing people know me for two things. The first is my rivalry with him. I don't know why it became such a big thing. We were just drivers busting each other's balls. To me this is perfectly normal, but other people saw it differently, that whatever it was between us went deeper. The other thing I'm remembered for <em>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</em> when I was chasing him like an asshole.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>JAMES : <em>I have a theory why women like racing drivers. It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles. Mostly they think that's pathetic, and they're probably right. It's our closeness to death. You see, the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. The more alive you are. And they can see that in you. They feel that in you. My name is James Hunt. My father is a stockbroker, my sister is a barrister and my brother is an accountant. And I... Well, I do this. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive. As if each day is your last.</em></p>
