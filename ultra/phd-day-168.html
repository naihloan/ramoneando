<p>An ultra marathon is any race longer than a <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/marathon">marathon</a> (26.2 miles). Ultras can be run on roads, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/trail-running">trails</a>, or <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-on-the-track">tracks</a>. There are two types of events: those in which runners set out to cover a fixed distance (50 kilometers, 100 miles, etc.) and those in which runners attempt to cover the greatest possible distance within a fixed period of time (such as 24 hours, 48 hours, or six days).</p>

<p>In 35 years, the marathon world record has fallen 13 times, and the half
marathon, 15 times. Yet no one has broken the Guinness World Record for
<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-crossing-of-america-(usa)-on-foot-(male)">fastest run across the United
States</a>: 46
days, 8 hours, and 36 minutes set by a running shoe salesman named Frank
Giannino Jr. on October 17, 1980. </p>

<p>It’s not that people haven’t tried. In 2008, renowned ultrarunners
Marshall Ulrich and Charlie Engle set out from San Francisco, hoping to
reach New York in less than 46 days. Engle dropped out. Ulrich settled
for the masters record, finishing in 52 and a half days. </p>

<p>Dozens of others have completed the trek: for charity, <a href="/general-interest/this-is-how-your-feet-will-look-if-you-run-across-the-us-barefoot">without
shoes</a>,
for their own bucket list, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/49476-3000-mile-race-across-us-science.html">in a
kilt</a>,
or because they <a href="/newswire/run-forrest-run-recent-college-grad-running-movie-route">really like Forrest
Gump</a>.
But despite ultramarathoning’s rise in popularity and exposure of
long-distance records like the <a href="/trail-racing/scott-jurek-celebrates-a-new-appalachian-trail-thru-hike-speed-record">Appalachian Trail
thru-hike</a>,
the decades old trans-American record still stands.</p>

<p>The next guy hoping to break it ran his first marathon three years ago
and his first ultramarathon less than two years ago. </p>

<p>His name is Adam Kimble. He’s 29 years old, sports a voluminous brown
beard, quit his job a year ago to travel the world with his wife, and
decided to tack on a run across the country partially because he isn’t
quite ready to get back to work. </p>

<p>“I am sure the fact that I have only been running ultras for a few years
makes people think that this guy has no idea what he is getting into,”
Kimble told <em>Runner’s World</em>. “But I know what my body is capable of and
we are going to make a strong run at it.”</p>

<p>On February 15, Kimble will leave Huntington Beach, California. With a
four-person crew in an RV, including his wife, Karen, he has mapped out
a 3,030-mile route through the southern portion of the country before
heading north to Manhattan. Guinness World Record officials stipulate
that a runner can take any route he or she wants, so long as it equals
or surpasses the 2,766 miles from Los Angeles to New York. Kimble has
added extra mileage to avoid winter weather in the north.</p>

<p>“I am always on the lookout for finding new ways to push myself and
obviously this is a whole new level from some of the things I have
done,” Kimble said. </p>

<p>He was a Division 1 collegiate baseball player at Bradley University and
ran his first road race, a 5K, in 2009. From there, he rapidly built up
mileage and found that the farther he ran, the better he felt. His job
as an event planner at Red Frog Events, the company that puts on the
Warrior Dash race series, was flexible and allowed him to train. In 2014
he took second place at the Yellowstone-Teton 100 miler. In 2015 he won
the 250K Gobi March.</p>

<p>Despite these impressive finishes, Kimble is a relative newcomer to the
ultramarathoning community. He thinks that’s an advantage. “I will be
more fresh,” [he said.]{} “I don’t have as much wear and tear on my
body.” </p>

<p>That’s important because in order to finish in less than 46 days, Kimble
must average 69 miles a day. He plans to be on the road for 14 to 16
hours. </p>

<p>“I really hope my body holds up,” he said. “Injury would be one thing
that puts a wrench in our plans.” </p>

<p>The other is weather. He chose to start in the middle of winter because
he prefers cooler temps. “We did our best to stay as far south in the
U.S. as we could. We wanted to give ourselves the best opportunity to
avoid snow.”</p>

<p>Yet even if he’s able to fend off injury and foul conditions, Kimble
said the hardest part may be keeping a strict regimen. He spoke with the
current record holder, Giannino, who said keeping a precise daily
routine is the best way to keep up with the mileage.</p>

<p>“Frank was doing almost the same thing every day, getting his body into
a rhythm,” Kimble said. “A lot of the people that have attempted the
record failed because in most cases they didn’t have a good enough
schedule and were a little too loose.”</p>

<p>To prepare his body for the distance, Kimble has been running from sunup to sundown on a 9.5-mile loop at a park near his home. His goal has been to put in multiple 50-plus mile days in a row to mimic the conditions during the record attempt. </p>

<p>“I see this as a unique opportunity to challenge myself, to set a crazy goal,” he said. “By no means is this going to be an easy task, but I think I am at a good point in my ultrarunning career to try it.”</p>

<p>If all goes well, Kimble will finish before March 31 in Times Square.</p>
