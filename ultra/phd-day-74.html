<aside> <em>
<p>Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there’s nothing else to gaze on,<br>
Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,<br>
Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,<br>
Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?<br>
Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking through it,<br>
Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?<br>
Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God’s sake go and do it;<br>
Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.</p>

<p>Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,<br>
The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?<br>
Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,<br>
And learned to know the desert’s little ways?<br>
Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o’er the ranges,<br>
Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?<br>
Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?<br>
Then <mark>listen to the Wild — it’s calling you</mark>.</p>

<p>Have you suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down, yet grasped at glory,<br>
Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?<br>
“Done things” just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,<br>
Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?<br>
Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?<br>
(You’ll never hear it in the family pew.)<br>
The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things —<br>
Then <mark>listen to the Wild — it’s calling you</mark>.</p>
<p>They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,<br>
They have soaked you in convention through and through;<br>
They have put you in a showcase; you’re a credit to their teaching —<br>
But can’t you hear the Wild? — it’s calling you.<br>
Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;<br>
Let us journey to a lonely land I know.<br>
There’s a whisper on the night-wind, there’s a star agleam to guide us,<br>
<mark>And the Wild is calling, calling . . . let us go</mark>.</p>
