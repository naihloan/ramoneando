<p>I just wrote by cell phone to Fer Petrei two days ago, my fellow runner from the group. Everyone has noticed I used five fingers (an adidas pair with vibram sole). So he showed/sent a video on a review of shoes that arrived locally. You can get these shoes through online purchase: mercadolibre. I was just about to buy a pair of fivefingers vrun. But this other option can be even better: altra escalante.</p>
<p>VRUN are good because flexible, zero drop, and lightweigt. ESCALANTE share those too, but they have more wiggle room for the fore foot. Which I may need because I have bunion in my left foot.</p>
