<blockquote>
<p>The HDAD drugs <em>do</em> help to concentrate, but we don´t know the effects, on creativtiy personality, dependence to drug ... the diagnosis doesn´t rely on a blood test. It´s a subjective assessment. <mark>A generation of kids being druged to get them through education. This means something is wrong with the education system.</mark> 11% have this diagnosis in usa. &quot;Being a human is being creative and going on a constant journey/quest&quot;. The idea is that you don't know the end but you're motivated to go forward. (My thought: What if I don´t want to do anything to earn something? Running allows a bit of this) (No utility, like art).</p>

<p>To be in your element you have to love it. (The end of the talk is great: know yourself and enjoy the effort and discovery of exploring the world, inner and outer!)</p>
