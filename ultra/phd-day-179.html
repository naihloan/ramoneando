<p>Plenty of research on ultra/endurance is done from a medical and/or technical point of view. Not so much from humanities side. One exception is Ludwig, Stephanie. 2011 | <em>The Embodied Spirituality of Women Who Practice Distance Running in Nature: ‚ÄòI Run in the Company of Trees and of Certain Friends‚Äô</em>. Unpublished PhD thesis. If I could apply for funding I can address two possibilities at the moment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply at <a href="http://ultrasportsscience.us/">ultrasportsscience.us</a> with a topic that is appealing enough to an audience. I believe that a research on craziness/happiness is due. This can be tackled in a reasonable way by simply reading the literature available written by runners. Also, taking into account medicalization from a social science view can add layers, even chemical ones, to the confrontation between depression and effort/comfort. Reading note: take into account Foucault&#8217;s <em>History of Madness</em>.</li>
<li>Contact german Professor Ralph <a href="rbeneke@essex.ac.uk">Beneke</a> since he has been studied ultra running since at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/may/06/highereducation.research">2004 | Guardian piece on <em>Academics go to extremes for research</em></a>.</li>

<p>Many scientists now recognize the harm done by restrictive scientific publishers that control use of the scientific literature. In 2002, the Budapest Open Access Initiative called for applying two principles in scientific publishing: access for everyone at the main publication site, and freedom for everyone to redistribute them as well.</p>

<p>The second principle is stronger. In practice, it gives us the first: if
everyone has the freedom to redistribute copies of articles, university
libraries will mirror the articles, making them accessible to everyone.
However, the term &#8220;open access&#8221; refers explicitly to the weaker first
principle and not to the second. That makes it a weak term.</p>

<p>I had misgivings about the term &#8220;open access&#8221;, seeing as how the
advocates of &#8220;open source&#8221; used the word &#8220;open&#8221; to downplay the Free
Software Movement&#8217;s concerns about freedom for software users. I put
them aside because the substance of the position was correct, and signed
the BOAI statement.</p>

<p>Alas, my misgivings have proved valid. Policies advanced today often
drop the more important second principle; they talk about accessibility
but don&#8217;t mention the freedom to redistribute them and reuse them in
other ways. For instance, a US bill in 2013 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/new-bill-helps-expand-public-access-scientific-knowledge">proposes gratis access to
papers from government-funded research, but fails to require freedom to
redistribute</a>.
It would be a step forward, but the principal point was dropped,
evidently because the campaign was for &#8220;open access&#8221;. A <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_0601-0650/ab_609_bill_20130220_introduced.htm">California
bill</a>
has the same flaw. &#8220;Open&#8221; has put society on the wrong track.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael Eisen of the Public Library of Science convinced me in 2012 that modifying and combining scientific papers is important for science. Previously I had believed that redistribution of exact copies was sufficient for these works, but now I believe they must be free/libre ‚Äî free as in freedom, that is, with the same <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms that define free/libre software</a>.</p>

<p>We must insist on &#8220;free (or libre) scientific publishing&#8221;, using words
that focus on the stronger principle of users freedom, and thus resist
the tendency to weaken the goal. Please don&#8217;t let your efforts be
diverted into activities that aim for merely &#8220;open&#8221;.</p>
