## Questions for Ultrarunners | As Open End Ideas for Research

#### Novices

- Ran an ultra once. How did you develop the motivation and learning to go beyond 42k? Would you do it again? Goals and obstacles for one race and further ones.
- Did you need special resources, such as nutrition, gear, money to travel, extra time, etc.?
- Did you hallucinate while racing (due to lack of salts and minerals)?
- Do you, and/or your family and fellow friends and coworkers, think that going ultra is crazy?
- Can you make a personal balance on the before and after of running ultra?
- Has your social and/or personal life changed?

#### Elite/Experienced

- Do you use specific methods to develop strength, speed, flexibility?
- How important and in which ways do you guide your nutrition? Perhaps with external guidance? Do you cook?
- How much do you attend to invisible training, such as resting?
- How do you prepare for the specifics of each race?
- How do you get your shoes, choose them, available locally?
- How do you, if so, train form/technique?
