<p>14/45. The running scene was inspired by an actual event. In 1982, Louis Michael Figueroa, aged 16, ran from New Jersey to San Francisco for the American Cancer Society, unknowingly inspiring a line for Forrest Gump's famous run on the silver screen. &quot;I just put one foot in front of the other,&quot; it goes. <a href="http://www.tickld.com/x/yahg/45-little-known-facts-about-forrest-gump/p-14">&quot;When I get tired I sleep. When I get hungry I eat. When I have to go to the bathroom, I go.&quot;</a></p>

The park bench that Tom Hanks sat on for much of the movie was located in historic Savannah, Georgia, at Chippewa Square.<a href="http://www.tickld.com/x/yahg/45-little-known-facts-about-forrest-gump/p-15"> The fiberglass bench he sat on, since then, has been removed and placed into a museum to avoid being destroyed by bad weather, or possibly stolen. </a>The church where the feather first falls was about 100 yards just down the street from the bench.

The character of Forrest Gump in the movie is a lot more passive and na√Øve than in Winston Groom's 1986 novel, where he's more cynical and abrasive. For instance, the actual line about chocolates, which opens the novel, is this:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Let me say this: bei'n a idiot is no box of chocolates. People laugh, lose patience, treat you shabby. Now they says folks s'posed to be kind to the afflicted, but let me tell you - it ain't always that way. Even so, I got no complaints, cause I reckon I done live a pretty interestin' life, so to speak.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

	<strong>secfor</strong>. <em>Am I the only one who has noticed that it is not gumps child. They had sex once and he never finished. She however, had sex with all those she could get between the legs. Not to mention that she was with the wave of hippie times where you took drugs and had unprotected sex criss-crossed by the campfire. She says nothing about the forrest gump is the father of her child, the only reason she said it later is because she has been diagnosed with an incurable disease. So she must of course want him to take care of her bastard of a kid. Throughout the movie we see her take advantage of the poor man and she does it in the fucking end too!</em>
