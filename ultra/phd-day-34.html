<ul>
<li>Breath through your nose for one minute every mile. Stabilizes core, and uses diaphragm</li>
<li>Check your cadence at the last 10% of your run</li>
<li>Legs fresh | Air Squats / Leg Swings</li>

<p>Important because this is most likely not possible for ultra. But who knows? Has anyone tried?</p>
<p>A lot of sunscreen was used. Previous food was a bit random.</p>
<p>Results? Blisters, sore knees, and biceps, and who knows if something else in <em>the long run</em> (pun intended)?</p>

<p>Amazing: it's very little time and the female runner gets a great race time! (Under 4 hs, perhaps under 3:30... )</p>

<p>This one is actually important because even if it's a mock of reality, and comedy, it still places a major point: people do other things aside from training and publishing merits in social networks. What is the real life of runners and ultra runners? How much does their activity interfere, OR NOT, in the rest of their life? How much does the rest of their life affect the training?</p>
