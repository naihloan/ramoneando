<p>The ultra-marathon runs themselves are worth max stars. Filmed in 2010 in: 1. Atacama, Chili desert (driest). 2. Gobi desert, China (windiest). 3. Sahara desert, Egypt (hottest). 4. Antarctica (coldest, and precipitation is very low). Each run is over about a five day period (each night is recovery time) and totaling, ball park, 150 miles each. Great quotes, &quot;What the hell am I doing here?&quot;, &quot;Marathon is too conventional.&quot; Most impressive, and we know this from so many human endeavors, are the lengths we go to to help others. (Yes, there are also many examples of &quot;me-firstism&quot;.) The most poignant helping was between Lisa and Samantha, and there were others.<br />
