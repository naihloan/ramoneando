<p>Pato me manda sugerencia de lectura sobre cómo consumimos <em>salud</em> sin pensar. Y pondera el gran criterio editorial de este diario británico.

<blockquote>
<p><em>the market for sports protein products alone – which excludes most of the mainstream brands – is expected to hit <mark>£413m</mark> this year and almost £750m (in today’s money) in five years’ time. // But experts have warned that consumers, particularly gym-goers, are falling <mark>victim to clever marketing</mark>.</em> [...] <em>Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, said people were being taken in by “nutri-babble”. “There’s been a lot of hype in gyms pushing high-protein shakes, there’s also a need to get rid of a waste product from the dairy industry, which is whey protein,” he said. “It’s a lot of crap, a way of selling a cheap product at a high price.”</em> [...] <em>As excess protein is excreted through urine, people who are consuming too much are effectively flushing their money down the toilet, according to the experts. // This also makes it unlikely that they are doing themselves harm – unless they already have kidney disease – but it could be problematic if high protein consumption replaces other foods important for good health such as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains, they said. “A lot of the products are high in sugar, low in fibre, they’re not healthy choices for consumers,” said Daniels.</em> <em>Darren Beale – founder of musclefood.com, which specialises in lean meats but also sells high-protein pizzas, chocolate and even beer – said gym-goers increasingly want to control what they put in their body. // “Are people eating too much protein? Depends on their health or fitness goal,” he said. “There’s research showing that a diet high in protein can help build muscle mass, but there has to be a macro balance with carbs and fat.</em> <em>None of the manufacturers of products mentioned in the article addressed the issue of the high amount of protein already in UK diets when contacted by the Guardian. // A Food and Drink Federation spokesman said: “Food manufacturers are responding to an increasing demand from consumers for high-protein food and drinks, which can be consumed as part of a healthy lifestyle. There is also some evidence that foods high in proteins can help us feel full for longer – increasing satiety and aiding appetite control – and this may be helpful for people trying to balance their energy intake. Protein content will always be clearly labelled, usually alongside how much of an adult’s recommended intake this represents, to help consumers make informed choices.”</em></p>
