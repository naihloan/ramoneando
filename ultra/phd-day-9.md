"Perhaps the genius of ultrarunning is its supreme lack of utility. It makes  no sense in a world of space ships and supercomputers to run vast distances  on foot. There is no money in it and no fame, frequently not even the  approval of peers. But as poets, apostles and philosophers have insisted  from the dawn of time, there is more to life than logic and common sense.  The ultra runners know this instinctively. And they know something else that  is lost on the sedentary. They understand, perhaps better than anyone, that  the doors to the spirit will swing open with physical effort. In running  such long and taxing distances they answer a call from the deepest realms of  their being -- a call that asks who they are ..."
- David Blaikie

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

## RUN FAST. LET GO. BOX LIKE MUHAMMED ALI
"Running fast requires conditioning your body, absorbing proper mechanics to the point where they're second nature, and then forgetting the details and letting it rip.  It may sound funny to someone who hasn't been there, but the more you can let go, the faster you can go. Look at films of Mohammad Ali in his prime and you'll see how he had that little wrist flick on the end of his jab; if he had to think about doing that, he couldn't have done it.  People have things inside them they don't know about until it comes out.  When somebody asks me how fast a human being can run, I tell them that however fast they think it is, it'll be faster."

drop out. You don't want to be out there saying, Well gee, my leg hurts,

And talk yourself into quitting.  If you are making a decision based on
how you feel at that moment, you will probably make the wrong decision."
- Dick Collins

## SLEEP LATER.  NO QUIT.
"The Quitter"
When you're lost on the trail with the speed of a snail
And defeat looks you straight in the eye
And you're needing to sit, your whole being says quit
You're certain it's your time to die.
But the code of the trail is "move forward don't fail"
Though your knees and ego are scarred.
All the swelling and pain is just part of the game
In the long run it's quitting that's hard!

"I'm sick of the pain!"  Well, now, that's a shame
But you're strong, you're healthy, and bright.
So you've had a bad stretch and you're ready to retch,
Shoulders back, move forward, and fight.
It's the plugging away that will win you the day,
Now don't be a loser my friend!
So the goal isn't near, why advance to the rear.
All struggles eventually end.

It's simple to cry that your finished; and die.
It's easy to whimper and whine.
Move forward and fight, though there's no help in sight
You'll soon cross the lost finish line.
You'll come out of the black, with the wind at your back,
As the clouds start to part; there's the sun.
Then you'll know in your heart, as you did at the start.
You're not a quitter.  You've Won!!
- by Gene Thibeault

To some, happiness is a warm puppy or a glass of cold beer.  To me, happiness is running in the hills with my mates around me."

"People think ultra is some kind of spaghetti eating contest for people
with no talent to do anything else. But there's a lot going on. I break
it down into the physical, the mental and endurance. Physical is the
only gender-specific area; men have more muscle mass, the strongest man
is always going to be stronger than the strongest woman. But I think
physical is only a small percentage of ultra. The mental part includes
preparation, strategizing, problem solving. How do you deal with 22
miles through snow, then overheating? How do you avoid allowing someone
to lure you into running their race? You have to learn how to run over
rocks downhill without trashing your quads; it's like skiing or dancing.
And then endurance. An ultra is not about pain - I think a marathon is
about pain, about intensity - but it's about hanging in through
tiredness and about staying nutritionally fueled. There is some evidence
that women may use fat more efficiently. And you have to want it, you
have to have the passion, you have to be willing to take the risks. You
