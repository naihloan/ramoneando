<p>Rafa Nadal appears on the tv: but on a golf course. Actually it was on espn when golf competition was on going. I wasn't really watching this, I was just using the pc and my wife came to say hi on Sunday and we both noticed this appearance after I glanced to the screen and said &quot;how cool!&quot;. To which she replied &quot;who would you like to be if you could be a reknown sports person?&quot;</p>
<p>First of all I liked the question, and it left me thinking. I should need to decide which amounts and kinds of sports I'd like the most. She liked Nadal with his moxy/garra. The sports my mind ranged through would be chess, running, judo, soccer, tennis. One person I compared to Nadal was Steve Pre Prefontaine. Who else is there to it? I recall the article titled <em>groat</em> in the short web address from <a href="https://rw.runnersworld.com/pdf/groat.pdf?_ga=2.60298413.1892617468.1517769581-1669054977.1506350402">Runner's World: Great Runners of All Time</a>. Article by <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/fun/who-is-the-greatest-runner-of-all-time">Mark Remy</a>. And some more info on <a href="http://www.thegoatseries.com/greatest-distance-runner-of-all-time/">Zapotek, Bekele and other great icons</a>, even on Pre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>While his legend may have been magnified by his untimely death, there is no doubt that the man they lovingly called &quot;Pre&quot; had miraculous talent and mental fortitude and was surely one of the GOATs of his sport.</em></p>
