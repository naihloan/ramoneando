<h1 id="fellatio">Fellatio</h1>
<p>Once upon a time I began running, following my dad's example. The cholesterol runs high in the family blood, so up to there we can have a conversation on genetics and what is natural. I started around age 12 or 14, and just enjoyed moving around with a calm pace that just freshened the mind. On that track I just kept running longer and longer distances until I stopped for a long while.</p>
<p>Some times the environment helps me remind of the old days in which I began running. Now for instance I am running in the same public park as in the beginning: Parque Sarmiento. The place is quite nice and green and expanded enough to not repeat the views of circuit too much. However, there are a lot of mixed populations that make to bizarre encounters.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in my teen years I was running in one of the inner laps of the park, where there is a little less circulation, also on a random weekday during work hours. And I found that next to the sidewalk there was a car with a person seated inside and a woman was giving head. Today I saw the same kind of situation in broad light and in a more circulated area. The 1st time was where cyclists train, and the 2nd was in front of the amusement park <em>SuperPark</em>. Seems perhaps lightning can strike more than twice in the same place.</p>
<p>All hail conviviality.</p>
