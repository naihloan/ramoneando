<h1 id="brainendurancetraining">Brain Endurance Training</h1>

<p>I tried out a researcher&#8217;s new brain training protocol, and it wasn&#8217;t easy.</p>

<p>Sep 17, 2013</p>

<p>I ran my first marathon a few months ago. In addition to the usual
training &#8211; tempos, intervals, long runs, mileage &#8211; I did 12 weeks of
computer-based &#8220;brain endurance training&#8221; with the aim of reducing
mental fatigue and perception of effort, following a protocol develop by
Samuele Marcora, a researcher at the University of Kent. It was a very
interesting experience, which I wrote about in a feature in this month&#8217;s
(October) issue of <em>Runner&#8217;s World</em>. <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/how-to-build-mental-muscle/">The article is now available to
read online here, so please check it out if you have a
chance</a></p>

<p>As is pretty much always the case, I had to leave out lots of
interesting research in order to make the article fit, for instance on
the role of caffeine, motivational self-talk, and so on. I do think the
role of mental fatigue &#8211; and, potentially, brain training &#8211; is going
to get a lot more attention in the next few years. But if anyone has any
questions about the concept, or criticisms, or personal experiences to
share, please do it in the comments below!</p>

<p>Incidentally, the brain training protocols I used aren&#8217;t yet available
to the public, but Marcora has <a href="http://www.brainendurancetraining.com/">a new Brain Endurance Training website
here</a> where you can
sign up to get updates, and where I believe the brain training programs
will eventually be posted.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the opening few paragraphs of the feature:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I spring out of bed, pull on my shorts and trainers, slather on sunscreen, and sit down at my computer. It&#8217;s 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning in mid-May, two weeks before the start of my first marathon, and time for my final big test.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>On the screen, an empty road disappears into a blue sky dotted with drifting clouds, rendered in simple '80s-video-game graphics. With a sigh, I empty my mind and click a blue button marked &#8220;start,&#8221; bracing myself for the drudgery ahead. Shapes begin flashing, sometimes to the left of the road and sometimes to the right. When it&#8217;s a triangle, I hit a button corresponding to its position on the screen, and I do it as quickly as possible, usually within a few hundred milliseconds. When it&#8217;s a circle, I do nothing. If I fail to respond within two seconds or I respond incorrectly, the screen flashes red and the computer emits an angry buzz.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. For the next 60 minutes, my sole task is to keep my <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/psychology/train-your-brain-to-run-your-best">brain</a> locked on this excruciatingly dull parade of shapes. They flash by rapidly, leaving no time to daydream, check the clock, or even glance out the window. Still, thoughts intrude. I wonder how hot it is outside, whether I should have started earlier&#8230;BZZZ. The screen turns red. The longer I continue, the more frequent my mistakes become. When the hour is finally up, I have that cotton-headed feeling of total mental exhaustion that&#8217;s usually the cue to flop down in front of the TV for a few hours of mindless reruns. Instead, I down a glass of water, step outside, and start running.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I lope through two miles, then gradually squeeze the pace down. I have a 15-mile progression run planned, with the last six at marathon pace. My legs feel fine, but the pace feels tougher than it should, and I have to concentrate hard to sustain it. Once again, I force my brain to zero in on yet another monotonous task: keeping my legs moving and hitting my goal splits. As far as my brain is concerned, the effort feels more like the last 15 miles of a marathon than the first 15.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly what I&#8217;m aiming for.</p>
