<p>By <a href="/author/216971/tom-layman/" class="byline-name">Tom Layman</a></p>

<p>It’s hard to find anything simpler than firing through episode after episode of old sitcoms or wiping out chunks of time with random movies on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Then there are the documentaries you never thought you’d be interested in, but can’t stop watching.</p>
<p>For runners, there are other chunks of time when it is a perfect to get their binge on with a great documentary, like while recovering on the couch after a long run or when cranking out miles on the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/treadmills/" class="body-link">treadmill</a> at home.</p>
<p>And if you’re looking for the right kind of motivation to get out the door, a bevy of running documentaries exist that hit just the right tone of inspiring and gripping.</p>
<p>We collected a list of documentaries, some more well-known and others, to get you in the spirit of putting one foot in front of the other. Find the film that’s best for you, and enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="into-the-wind">Into the Wind</h3>
<p>Follow the journey of <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a20783824/terry-foxs-marathon-of-hope/" class="body-link">Terry Fox</a>, an amputee runner who was diagnosed with cancer, as he attempted to run across Canada in 1980. The film premiered in 2010 as part of the 30 for 30 series on ESPN. The filmmakers (one of which was NBA legend Steve Nash) spoke with those closest to Fox as he set out to cover more than a marathon distance each day in hopes of raising awareness and money for cancer research. Fox was was just 21 years old at the time, and although it’s a true story and easy to find out what happened to the young Canadian, we won’t play spoiler about how it ends.<br />
