<h2 id="training-day-monday">Training Day [Monday]</h2>
<p>Most calm session until now. We did the traditional 20 mins back and forth to the training circuit. This time we did Las Brujas. However, next week we're going to add another point, another hill, at Dante's Avenue (coincidence it's called the same name than our chief of the training group).</p>
<p>In mid session we did first 2 laps to the circuit: a lap and a counter-lap, in opposite direction. After that we did 3 more circuits, at an easy pace, done with no groups, just each one as is. It was to be a calm run, with only one uphill with more effort, at %80. It was a more or less easy day. Later on he said that we could try a long run for Tuesday.</p>
