<h2 id="doctor-strange-2016v">Doctor Strange [2016v]</h2>
<p><em>I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What just happened?</li>
<li>For a moment, you entered the astral dimension. A place where the soul exists apart from the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet.</p>
<p>Thoughts create reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. [rick n morty!]</p>
<p>Worlds without end.</p>
<p>Some benevolent and life-giving; others filled with malice and hunger.</p>
<p>Dark places, where powers older than time lie... ravenous... and waiting.</p>
<p>Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?</p>
<hr />
<p>The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language &quot;spells&quot;. But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it &quot;program&quot;. The source code that shapes reality.</p>
<p>We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic.</p>
