<h2 id="tinker-hatfield">Ali </h2>
<h4>(2001v)</h4>

<p>Prompted in the street, Ali is running and he gets this question from afar: police says <em>What are you running from son?</em> This just is in sync not only with the struggle by and against <em>negros</em> but also with the relative unfamiliarity of jogging as a practice, time in which it was just beginning to increase in popularity.</p>
<p>In a near scene from the beginning Cassius Clay is training in the gym and the couch says that he should always move when jumping the rope. Going sideways, and back to front. Allegedly it's <em>bad to stay in one place</em>. Why is this? And, does it apply at all to running?</p>
