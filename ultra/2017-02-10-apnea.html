<h5>Ted Talk</h5> 
<p>Ana Bielewicz recommended this video. The speaker goes through several topics, moments and experiences of diving 123 mts below surface. After 40 mts it's a free fall down. In the lower limit, once said impossible, it's vastness, calm, humbling. Going up is very hard, and the urge to breath comes back again. The lungs and stomach regain their size after being crushed.</p>
<p>Interesting is that the idea of floating below water has relation with state of mind and spirit. <em>Don't breath</em> recommends Guillaume <em>and you'll stop thinking</em>. Sounds quite refreshing. Feel yourself gliding through water, and it's like flying. Let nature and your body to speak to you. Maybe you can go further than what you thought.</p>
