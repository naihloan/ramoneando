<p>“The brief span of an individual life is misleading. Each one of us is as old as the entire biological kingdom, and our bloodstreams are tributaries of the great sea of its total memory. The uterine odyssey of the growing foetus recapitulates the entire evolutionary past, and its central nervous system is a coded time scale, each nexus of neurones and each spinal level marking a symbolic station, a unit of neuronic time.” ― J.G. Ballard, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/988766-the-drowned-world"><em>The Drowned World</em></a></p>
