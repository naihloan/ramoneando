<p>When you write in Vim, it doesn’t pretend that you’re looking at a book. It’s text. The notion of ‘presentation’ is off the table. Layout can take a running jump.</p>
<p>Vim presents you with the text at a much simpler level. [...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To <em>Vim</em> (verb): To remove superficial presentation in order to reveal sub­stance.</p>
<p>Example: ‘We were larging it at the <em>Time Piece</em> last week until the last tune, <em>Get Lucky</em>. Then the main lights came on, the music turned off, and the bouncers moved in. The place was totally vimmed.’</p>

<h1 id="to-vim" class="entry-title">To Vim</h1>
<p>I see that Apple has updated its word-pro­cessor <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/pages/">Pages</a> again. The new ver­sion has some sweet fea­tures, but if you open a doc­u­ment cre­ated in the pre­vi­ous ver­sion, you will be asked if you wish to upgrade the file format. On click­ing ‘yes’, the pre­vi­ous ver­sion of Pages will nev­er again be able to open the file.</p>
<p>That, in itself, is not a prob­lem. But, let’s say, you don’t upgrade your ver­sion of Pages imme­di­ately. Let’s say you wait until the ver­sion after that. Will <em>that</em> ver­sion open the files you have right now? Possibly not.</p>
<p>When a file format is updated, you get new fea­tures. I under­stand that and I applaud. But there are dis­ad­vant­ages. Once you’ve been writ­ing for a few years, and you look back for your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy</a>, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claris">ClarisWorks</a> files, or even your <a href="http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=37773&amp;type=Software">Kindwords</a> files, you real­ise that file format change is the krypton­ite of lon­get­iv­ity.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html">this art­icle by Charles Stross</a> on Microsoft Word, entitled ‘Why Microsoft Word Must Die’. Now, we all hate Word, don’t we? Come on. You do.</p>
<p>I hate Word from a pos­i­tion of some expert­ise, because, back in 2003–2005, I used it to write my PhD thes­is. That was a single doc­u­ment con­tain­ing mul­tiple con­tents tables (some for chapters, sure, but oth­ers for psy­cho­lin­guist­ic examples), cross-ref­er­ences, a bib­li­o­graphy, and a great deal besides. I learned the hell out of that pro­gram. Thus did I learn to hate it. It is buggy, poorly designed, and over-fea­tured.</p>
<p>Going back to the point made by Charles Stross, it is a real shame that the pub­lish­ing industry relies on Word as its work­horse.</p>
<p>Stross men­tioned anoth­er pro­gram that he some­times uses. It is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a>. I also use it.</p>
<h2 id="formatwars:anewhope">Format Wars: A New Hope</h2>
<p>Back in 1976, the year I was born, Bill Joy wrote a text edit­or for UNIX. That edit­or was called <em>vi</em>. It was designed to work over a com­puter ter­min­al (i.e. a text-based inter­act­ive inter­face). It had two modes. In the first mode, whatever the user typed would be entered as text in the cur­rent doc­u­ment. In the second mode, the key­board became a way of nav­ig­at­ing around the doc­u­ment. You can read more about the pro­gram over at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The pro­gram was updated by Bram Moolenaar for the Commodore Amiga, a com­puter I used as a kid. Moolenaar called his pro­gram <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a>. This stood for ‘Vi improved’. The year was 1991.</p>
<h2 id="whatsitlikeusingvim">What’s It Like Using Vim?</h2>
<p>Where I grew up, we often bought fruit from the vil­lage shop. The apples didn’t come from China or South America. They tasted good, but were a bit small and occa­sion­ally bruised. Later, we bought fruit from super­mar­kets. They were nev­er bruised and they all looked the same. Didn’t taste as good, but by then I’d for­got­ten what non-super­mar­ket apples tasted like. Nowadays I eat ponsy ‘organ­ic’ apples, and they tend to come from Kent, where I live. They’re smal­ler, more bruised, but the taste real.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Is Vim some kind of home-grown product? No, it’s American.</p>
<p>Is it tasti­er than Microsoft Word or Apple Pages?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>It’s like this. When you write in Vim, it doesn’t pre­tend that you’re look­ing at a book. It’s text. The notion of ‘present­a­tion’ is off the table. Layout can take a run­ning jump.</p>
<p>Vim presents you with the text at a much sim­pler level.</p>
<p>If you—by which I mean ‘me’—write a story in Word, or Pages, and print that bad boy out, the product you hold in your hand is some­what disin­genu­ous. It mas­quer­ades as a fin­ished product. The imper­fec­tions and short­falls of your prose are very slightly obscured by the lay­out and present­a­tion, both of which are telling you, uncon­sciously, that the work is already like the work you see in books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To <em>Vim</em> (verb): To remove super­fi­cial present­a­tion in order to reveal sub­stance.</p>
<p>Example: ‘We were lar­ging it at the <em>Time Piece</em> last week until the last tune, <em>Get Lucky</em>. Then the main lights came on, the music turned off, and the boun­cers moved in. The place was totally vimmed.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every imper­fec­tion jumps out. It’s just you, your eye­balls, and your text.</p>

<h3 id="vimisfast">Vim is Fast</h3>
<p>When you’re typ­ing text into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">com­mand line</a>, the com­puter is not ren­der­ing graph­ic­al gub­bins. Letters appear slightly faster. Not so much faster that you notice it in Vim, but fast enough to notice that text ren­der­ing is slower in most oth­er places, not­ably Word and Pages.</p>
<h3 id="vimasalearningcurve">Vim as a Learning Curve</h3>
<p>Vim has key­board short­cuts for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting sen­tences</li>
<li>Moving the caret to the start/beginning of a sen­tence</li>
<li>Moving x words for­ward or back</li>
<li>Jumping to the top of the doc­u­ment, to the bot­tom, to the middle, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>These take <a href="http://www.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html">time to learn</a>. I’m still learn­ing them. But, even after a few minutes, it becomes much faster to nav­ig­ate a doc­u­ment using the key­board than using the mouse.</p>

<p>Vim is used by a lot of geeks (mostly for pro­gram­ming). I’ve nev­er encountered a bug or had it crash.</p>

Hey Ian,

This is self-pro­mo­tion­al, but my big script­ing pro­ject for vim
has just reached a mostly mature state. It is a pan­nable, zoom­able
‘infin­ite plane’ for organ­iz­ing massive amounts prose called
“textabyss”. Check it out at:

&lt;https://github.com/q335r49/textabyss&gt;

Thanks!

Leon

Hi Leon

Thanks for the link. I checked out the video and I think the concept
looks really inter­est­ing. Reminds me a bit of the Archie(?)
frame­work sug­ges­ted by Jeff Raskin, one of the ori­gin­al Mac
guys. I haven’t got time to explore your Vim pro­ject at the moment,
but best of luck with it.

Cheers

Ian</code></pre>
