<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of quitting is rededication - an invigorated new strategy designed to break the problem apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do. That’s why it’s so important for you to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting. When people quit, they are often focused on the short-term benefits.</p>
<p>Quitting when you’re panicked is dangerous and expensive. The best quitters are the ones who decide in advance when they’re going to quit. You can always quit later - so wait until you’re done panicking to decide.</p>
