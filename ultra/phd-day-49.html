<p>So meditation, or mindfulness practice, it's really about, to me, decreasing emotional reactivity so you can proactively create your day and create your life; versus, just being a walking reflex that sometimes screws up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words you're sitting on your couch watching the sensations in your body, in such a way that you're observing your body and your mind’s reaction. So, perhaps over time, rather than flying off the handle and getting angry at someone for a, b, and c infraction … there’s that little moment between what they do and your response and you're able to &quot;Oh … I see myself getting tight in the chest. I'm about to get angry. Let me pause. And then give a more rational reaction.&quot; Where you actually get the result you want, instead of the conflict that might be very gratifying for a second then creates a whole host of other issues for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And for those people who are wondering where to start … there are many ways to start. But I really think the simplest place is an app called &quot;Headspace.&quot; Just do the &quot;10 and 10,&quot; that's 10 minutes for 10 days straight. Give that a go. And it'll give you at least a taste of what it can do.</p>
