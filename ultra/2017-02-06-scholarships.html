<h3 id="proposal-guidelines">Proposal guidelines</h3>
<p>Your research proposal should be no longer than 1,000-1,250 words (3 or 4 sides of A4) and contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name. Benjamin Juarez</li>
<li>proposed programme of study. College of Social Sciences and International Studies. Department of Sociology, Philosophy and Anthropology Sociology, Science and Technology Studies (STS)</li>
<li>tentative title of thesis. Distance athlete’s æffect on urban rhythm. How do ultrarunners run in automatized cities?</li>
<li>proposed supervisor (if known). Michael Schillmeier</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aims and objectives - set out the central aims and research questions that guide your research. What hypothesis or argument are you trying to explore and what questions are you trying to answer? When outlining your questions try to prioritise one or two central questions from which you can derive secondary ones.</li>
<li>Rationale - contextualise your questions/aims in a broader field of study, identifying the main literature that you are addressing. You need to explain why your research questions/hypotheses are important and topical.</li>
<li>Methodology - explain how you are going to conduct your research; what information you would need, how you would collect it and how you are going to analyse it. This need only be indicative at the moment.</li>
<li>Timeline – You don’t need to produce a detailed time plan, but it is helpful to provide a summary of what you are planning to do and when. You will be expected to submit your thesis within three years (six years for part-time students) so it is important you have a feasible timeline. This section is especially important if you are proposing to undertake case study work or fieldwork.</li>
<li>Bibliography – a short bibliography of relevant works in your research area.</li>
</ul>
