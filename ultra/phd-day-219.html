<li>Marty Hoffman, MD | RESEARCH COMMITTEE DIRECTOR &gt;&gt; He has published over 140 original scientific publications mostly related to applied exercise physiology with focus on human locomotion, human performance and exercise-associated hyponatremia. His clinical work has involved cardiac rehabilitation, musculoskeletal medicine and sports medicine.</li>
<li>Ricardo Costa, PhD, Registered Dietitian, Registered Sports Dietitian &gt;&gt; Focus on the nutritional and hydration status in ultra-endurance running, physiological responses to ultra-endurance in the heat, impact of endurance exercise on the immune system and nutritional counter-measures, and the impact of endurance exercise (with and without heat-stress) on gut health including prevention and management strategies.</li>
<li>R√©my Hurdiel, PhD &gt;&gt; Examining preparation for sleep management for ultra endurance sportspeople, in solo navigation, ultra marathons and other sporting challenges such as rowing and nautical expeditions. For several years he has also been helping amateur ultra-marathoners, notably on the Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc¬Æ trail race. He works closely alongside American research teams with the aim of setting up procedures for sleep management based on mathematical predictions.</li>
<li>Gr√©goire Millet, PhD &gt;&gt; He is the Chief Editor of ‚ÄúFrontiers in Exercise Physiology‚Äù and is regularly invited to conferences world-wide. Gr√©goire is the author of several books on endurance or altitude training. His main research topics are: (1) physiological responses to exercise in hypoxia; (2) optimization of interval-training; (3) mechanical / physiological coupling in sport locomotion; (4) analysis of fatigue (neuromuscular and heart rate variability); (5) ultra-endurance.<br />
</li>
<li>Guillaume Millet, PhD &gt;&gt; In the Human Performance Laboratory and the Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary (Canada) where he leads a research group on neuromuscular fatigue (www.ucalgary.ca/nmfl). His general research area investigates the physiological, neurophysiological and biomechanical factors associated with fatigue, both in extreme exercise (ultra-endurance, hypoxia) and patients (neuromuscular diseases, cancer). Guillaume has published 5 books and about 170 papers in international journals with peer review. He has supervised over 45 postdoctoral fellows and graduate students and he served as an external reviewer for more than 50 PhD candidates. Among other results, he placed 3 times in the top-6 at the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc¬Æ. He is also a consultant for Salomon¬Æ.</li>
<li>David Oxborough, PhD &gt;&gt; As an academic and researcher, David has published over 100 peer-reviewed papers on echocardiography and its applications in Clinical and Exercise Cardiology. He has continuously worked in the imaging-based assessment of sudden cardiac death syndromes and pre-participation screening environment and has screened over 7000 athletes. He has continued to study the impact of endurance exercise on the heart and has traveled to endurance and ultra-endurance events across the globe to gain further insight into the acute cardiac effects of prolonged strenuous exercise and subsequent chronic adaptation. His work continues to explore this unique group of athletes aiming to answer the question as to whether too much exercise can be deleterious.</li>
<li>Pierre Sallet, PhD in Sports Science. &gt;&gt; An internationally recognized expert on the battle against doping. He is President of the Athletes For Transparency (AFT) association with aim to preserve sports ethics, and he also promotes healthy trail running practice as a founding member of the International Trail Running Association (ITRA). He is also founder of NOVALIMIT, a company that specializes in innovation for the sports industry</li>
<li>Kristin Stuempfle, PhD &gt;&gt; Her research interests include examining the physiological challenges of ultra-endurance running. More specifically, she is interested in hyponatremia, gastrointestinal distress, and the food and fluid needs of ultra-runners.</li>
<li>Gianluca Vernillo, PhD &gt;&gt; Former Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, under the supervision of Prof. Guillaume Millet, at the Human Performance Laboratory in the Faculty of Kinesiology at the University of Calgary (Canada). Gianluca completed his PhD at the University of Milan examining the physiological and performance profile of endurance athletes. During his PhD, he actively collaborated with Kenyan marathon runners during the four-year period leading to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. His research interests lie in the areas of the neurophysiological and biomechanical changes associated with running and ultra-running and the physiological and performance profile of snowboarding. In recent years, his work has focused on better understanding the neuromuscular fatigue in response to exercise, particularly on the inter-limb differences.</li>
