<p>So I lost my night-trail virginity. I had some plans but most of them came apart pretty soon in the race. #1 thing was that I couldn't avoid walking in long parts of the race since virtually everyone did so in the steep uphills. My plans gone to wreck were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Keep a 180 RPM cadence. Most people check on their speed at a minutes per kilometer/mile rate. I think that with proper cadence you can run steadily without getting to heavy without noticing.</li>
<li>Focusing on leaving my foot strike behind, and not focusing on stretching the foot forwards. This would help to not break the forward momentum.</li>
<li>Keep my torso light, I tend to send my shoulders backwards a little too much.</li>
<li>Check on breathing, bostly exhaling.</li>
<li>Unplanned thing gone well: nutrition. I had plenty of liquid and salts because I began with a bottle of water with gel. Also I had an extra bar for midroad.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was supposed that there was going to be a technical talk. I thought maybe they would say how to avoid getting hurt against the rocks in the downhills, or how to stay away from the barb wired fences. Instead they just said that there would be hidration posts with some snacks at kms 5 7,5 &amp; 11.</p>
<p>Each time I would get some potato chips, gum candies, banana, and a bit more of liquid.</p>
<p>Surprise: I slipped and fell twice in a one meter downhill. Next time choose better shoes and perhaps carry a cane. Lights were just fine. Nice Race. To be repeated.</p>
<p>Other surprise: I was going with little protection for my legs. So I followed a double advice from a fellow runner at the beginning of the race: have fun, and take care of some kind of compression sock. This way your calves stay tight and with good blood circulation. Also it helps the anckles to go with enough strentgh not to get bent.</p>
