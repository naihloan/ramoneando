<h4 id="cunts-jack-asses">3 <del>cunts</del> jack-asses</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a car driver goes very fast in Dante Av and I am running through the boulevard. I don't like that one bit.</li>
<li>another car driver goes very fast moving through Rondeau street exiting the park and I am running below sidewalk.</li>
<li>immediately after previous: another car passes behind slowly and stops my momentum from crossing to the other side.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="a-dog">a dog</h4>
<p>Animals, not only frogs, cross the street. they can sense the flow. I see a dog measure the timing of one car go pass and cross before the next one comes near even if he notices that a second car is coming a little bit further away. a <em>predator</em> would see the same animals for dogs or humans with caloric thermo-vision, and perhaps cars as also heated machines with likely another temperature than living beings.</p>
<h4 id="two-of-the-regular-habitue-groups">two of the regular habitue groups</h4>
<p>Skaters and running group in the bright late lights (of an elsewhere dark space) of inner park, despite Friday night.</p>
<h4 id="the-other-of-eating-people">the other of eating people</h4>
<p>People listening to cuarteto's popular music while going to eat popular foods such as choris and ice-creams.</p>
<h4 id="bonus">Bonus</h4>
<p>A homeless person, with old dirty hair and clothes holds a sign at a traffic light in my first loop. By the second, of three loops, he is no longer there. He carried a cardboard that I imagine had some writing for begging. Not a regular of the park-side but definitely a regular of the city, and the night.</p>
