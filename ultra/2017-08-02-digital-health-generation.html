<p>Estoy anotado en un newsletter de Inglaterra sobre Science and Technology Studies. Me llega un correo de Emma Rich que abrieron una página web de un proyecto que une 3 universidades y están planeando actividades para los próximos 2 años: <a href="https://www.digitalhealthgeneration.net/people/">Digital Health Generation</a>. Veo el perfil de los que forman parte. Me impresiono con la cara de uno que parece pibe y lleva mucho cv:</p>
