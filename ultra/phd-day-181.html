<p>With no spectators, no bags of freebies and no medals, the 400km
London-Wales-London ride provides a welcome antidote to overblown
sportives</p>

<p>“Cycling far?” asks a woman in the bakery as a group of us queues for
coffee and sausage rolls, as well as an all-important receipt to prove
we passed through Tewkesbury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Increasing numbers of cyclists are getting bored with 100-mile
sportives and looking for something else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Er … London to Wales,” replies a cyclist behind me. A pause. “And
back.” It must be hard not to look smug – he’s probably been dying for
someone to ask him that all day.</p>

<p>Some 130 of us are doing just that. We’ve been over the Chilterns and
through picture-postcard Cotswold villages. Soon we’ll labour up the 24%
ramp of Yat Rock, whizz down the Wye valley to Chepstow, nip into Wales
and cross back into England over the old Severn bridge. Then it’s up
past the Somerset monument, across the North Wessex Downs, over the
Chilterns again and we’re done. At 407km, the
<a href="https://londonwaleslondon.com/">London-Wales-London</a> ride
does have a truly epic feel.</p>

<p>This is my first taste of audax: a noncompetitive form of long-distance
cycling that traces its history to the 1890s, not long after the
invention of the modern bicycle. I was expecting old men on steel-framed
bikes with calves cast from iron and glasses held together with gaffer
tape, cake and clipboards in dusty village halls, and checkpoints on
bleak petrol station forecourts. Only part of that was true.</p>

<p>A few years ago I wouldn’t have been far wrong. The London-Wales-London
ride had been running for decades under the name of Severn Across, and
until recent years the average turnout was around 35 riders.</p>

But ultra-distance cycling has surged in popularity. Just as runners who
have tackled a few regular marathons might think “what now?” and have a
go at an ultramarathon, increasing numbers of cyclists are looking for
something more than a 100-mile sportive. This appears to be down partly
to self-supported races like the
<a href="http://www.transcontinental.cc/">Transcontinental</a> across
Europe and the 6,800km
<a href="https://transambikerace.com/">Transamerica</a>, partly to
the profile of riders like the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/31/british-cyclist-mike-hall-killed-during-race-in-australia">Mike
Hall</a>
and partly to that familiar human urge to try for a little bit more.</p>

Spend any time looking into ultra-distance and audax events and you’ll
soon hear about the 1,200km
<a href="http://www.aukweb.net/events/pbp/">Paris-Brest-Paris</a> and
the 1,400km
<a href="https://londonedinburghlondon.com/">London-Edinburgh-London</a>,
which are both held every four years.</p>

<p>Last year, organiser Liam FitzPatrick rebranded the Severn Across ride
as London-Wales-London. This year the event sold out in under eight
hours. FitzPatrick opened a waiting list but closed it once he had
another 75 names. The flow of emails from disappointed riders continued
right up to the big day.</p>

<p>So what I got when I arrived at Chalfont St Peter community centre at
6am on a bright May Saturday morning was a lot of fit cyclists, some
expensively cut Lycra and merino, a clutch of carbon bikes … and the odd
crusty old-timer.</p>

<p>Riders cross back into England over the old Severn bridge.
Conscious that it’s all too easy to overdo it early on – a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/jul/15/-sp-running-gobi-march-ultramarathon-china">lesson
learned from a few
ultramarathons</a>
– I pottered along comfortably enough to the first checkpoint at
Woodstock after 70km. I was somewhat surprised to be greeted by a full
fry-up – some of the old reputation clearly still rings true – but I’d
missed breakfast so wasn’t complaining.</p>

<p>There is time to chat to fellow riders, so I struck up conversations,
asking people about their setups (lots had dynamo hubs to generate
electricity for lights and GPS units) and trying to pick up ideas for
future events. Many are aiming for Paris-Brest-Paris next year, and a
fair few tackled London-Edinburgh-London in 2017. The growth of
ultra-distance cycling can be seen in the participation numbers for that
event: 29 starters in 1989, 1,500 last year.</p>

<p>A completed brevet card. Some controls are staffed; others are ‘free’
(riders collect a receipt) or ‘information’ (riders answer a question).
FitzPatrick had warned me before the event that the mental challenge
could be tougher than the physical. “What makes it difficult isn’t so
much the speed, it’s that you’ve got time to think,” he said. “If your
thighs hurt or you’ve got saddle sores then you might have another eight
hours of this, grinding you down. When it’s three in the morning, when
you’ve had a couple of punctures, when it’s cold and wet … that’s when
it gets to you.”</p>

<p>His advice for finishing successfully was to pay extra attention to
staying hydrated (easy to forget on long events) and not to spend too
long riding alone, especially at night.</p>

<p>Following his first suggestion, I stopped to refill my water bottles
outside the three staffed checkpoints – which meant I did spend some
time on godforsaken petrol station forecourts. For the second, I teamed
up with fellow rider Alex Kew when we found ourselves at the same pace.</p>

<blockquote>

and wet … That’s when it gets to you</p>

<p>Liam FitzPatrick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not always easy to know when to hold back or when to press on, but
I eased off when he was struggling up Yat Rock; he paid that back many
times once he’d recovered. As a time trialist, Alex couldn’t help
himself every time we hit a long straight A-road – he was on the front,
head down, powering away, and all I had to do was stick to his back
wheel. The miles flew by.</p>

<p>Darkness fell. Surrounded by silence but for the whirr of wheels and the
sound of breathing, we negotiated gravelly, potholed single-track roads
at 30mph with just a pair of small lights to fight the pitch-black
night. The company took a lot of stress out of it.</p>

<p>London-Wales-London is not a race (technically it’s a <em>randonné</em>).
Riders are free to complete the 407km at whatever speed they want so
long as they average 15&#8211;30kph. That made the earliest allowable finish
10.30pm; the latest was 9am the next day.</p>

With no serious mechanicals, Alex and I rolled into Chalfont just before
midnight. The fastest riders – including world 24-hour time trial
champion <a href="https://twitter.com/jasmijnmuller1?lang=en">Jasmijn
Muller</a> – were
back before it got dark. The last rolled in at 8.20am.</p>

<p>London-Wales-London (or Chalfont-Chepstow-Chalfont, as one wag had it)
certainly lives up to its epic new name. Whether you’re an old-school
audaxer or someone dressed head to toe in Rapha with a fetish for
sleeping in bus shelters, it’s a welcoming way to explore.</p>

<p>And it’s an antidote to overblown sportives. Rolling in after 407km, we
got our brevet cards stamped and tucked into warming bowls of homemade
daal. There were no spectators lining the finish chute, no bag of
freebies, no medals – but it was all the better for it.</p>
