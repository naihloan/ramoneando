<h2 id="personal-statement">Personal statement</h2>
<p><strong>Dear Board of Admission,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m quite a curious person, and every time I find an interesting pointer, I follow it a long time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My inclination for Sociology is such an inner conviction that it has kept me travelling to find the opportunity to continue with research professionally. After attending Graduate school [UBA], ranking among the top 400 Universities of the world and 700 km away from my hometown, I went to Brazil for a Master’s degree [UNICAMP] –top 300. Now I feel that to enter the discussion among world colleagues it would be more than beneficial to keep updated and at a high-level of academic and intellectual standards.. I've learned from and adapted to each of these new environments with pleasure, and expect to do so again given the chance to research in Exeter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also see the big picture. I’d like my profession, my work and my colleagues’ work to be useful for the average person walking on the streets. I look forward to working with you and hope, within my possibilities, to give the University my very best.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sincerely yours,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Juarez</strong></p>
