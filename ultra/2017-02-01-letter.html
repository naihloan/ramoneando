<p>Dear Board of Admission,</p>
<p>I’m quite a curious person, and every time I find an interesting pointer, I follow it a long time.</p>
<p>My interest in Sociology is such an interior conviction that it has kept me travelling to find the chance to continue with Sociology professionally. 
After attending Graduate school [UBA] &ndash;700 km away from home, and among the top 400 Universities of the world&ndash;
 I went to Brazil for a Master degree [UNICAMP] &ndash;top 300. 
Now I feel that to entering the discussion among world colleagues it would be best to write and read more current
works in English (instead of local Spanish and Portuguese languages
alone) to keep updated and at a high-level of academic and intellectual standards. 
I’m in pursue of that. I've learned and adapted with pleasure in each of these new environments, 
and expect to do so again given the chance to research in Exeter.
</p>
<p>I also see the big picture. I’d like my profession, my work and my
colleague’s work, to be useful for the average person walking on the
street. I look forward to working with you and hope I can do all that
is in my possibilities to give the University my very best.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Benjamin Juarez</p>
