<p>Running round and round in circles for a full day and night? The things
Adharanand Finn will do in the service of the running blog &#8230;</p>

<p>Fri 22 Sep 2017 [11.51¬†BST]</p>

<p>[[M]{.drop-cap__inner}]{.drop-cap}any years ago, I worked as a writer
for Which? magazine, and often had to visit its testing laboratory in
Milton Keynes. Without giving away any secrets, they test things
vigorously at Which?. There were rooms for overheating microwave ovens
until they exploded. There were sound labs peopled with experts sitting
with their eyes closed. They had a bumpy treadmill-type thing for
testing baby buggies to see how they performed over hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>I thought of all this when I signed up, in a moment of madness, to the <a href="https://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/london-24">Self Transcendence 24-hour track race in Tooting</a>{.u-underline}. I would be a human guinea pig, I thought, running around in circles for hundreds of laps, testing out running products to see if they could really stand the heat. This was Which? magazine-level product testing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxCDIYDj6g">Like the Duracell bunny</a>{.u-underline}, I could be the ultimate kit tester, for a day.</p>

<p>So, how did it go? I started out dressed head to ankle in Inov8. Rain
was forecast, so I had on the <a href="https://www.inov-8.com/men/clothing/jackets/stormshell-waterproof-running-jacket-mens-green">Inov8 Stormshell
jacket</a>{.u-underline}.
Over the first seven hours or so, we got frequent heavy showers,
interspersed with bright sun. The jacket kept me completely dry, and was
a joy to run in. It‚Äôs very lightweight and breathable, so I didn‚Äôt
overheat in the slightest, and the hood was easy to pull up and down and
comfortable to wear both ways. I actually enjoyed the rain spells,
running with my hood up and peering out snug and dry, as though I was in
my own portable tent.</p>

<p>I had planned to change to different shorts and leggings during the
race, but as the day/night/next day wore on, the thought of needlessly
getting changed was too tiring to contemplate. This Duracell bunny
started running very low on juice after about 12 hours and so only the
most vital kit was tested &#8230; which in itself was part of the test, I
guess. Luckily, the <a href="https://www.inov-8.com/men/clothing/shorts">Inov8
shorts</a>{.u-underline} I
started in were so comfortable that I didn‚Äôt feel any need to change
them. They were lightweight and didn‚Äôt cause any problems of the
chaffing variety. The only slight issue, if I‚Äôm being finicky, was the
back pocket could have been a tiny bit bigger. My phone is quite small,
but it was a squeeze to get it in. Anyone hoping to carry around a
bigger phone, such as the more recent iPhones, may struggle.</p>

<p>And why did I need my phone? For music. I don‚Äôt usually run to music,
but I thought for a 24-hour race on the track, it might help pass the
time. People had suggested it could get boring out there running in
circles for 24 hours. In the event, it was many things, but it was never
boring. After a few hours, every lap was a journey in itself, an epic
challenge to be overcome, and music was mostly a distraction. I did have
two periods of the race when I felt like listening to music, which was
good, as I had brought along two wireless headphones to try out.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/uk/product/backbeat-fit">Plantronics Backbeat
FIT</a>{.u-underline}
were comfortable to wear, lightweight and have amazing sound quality.
They promised six hours of playtime fully charged, which was plenty for
my needs. However, I may be the world‚Äôs dumbest headphone user, because
I found it difficult to turn them on. I seemed to have to press and hold
down the on-button about five times before it worked. And occasionally
the tracks would skip if I bumped my phone.</p>

<p>Later on in the night, I switched to the <a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-wireless-pulse.html">Bose SoundSport
Pulse</a>{.u-underline}.
These had none of the skipping problems, and the sound quality was also
excellent. Rather than hook over your ear, though, these fit by
burrowing in. I‚Äôve never been a fan of this type of headphones as I
always feel like they are about to fall out. However, despite my
concerns and my movement (I‚Äôm not sure I could quite call it ‚Äúrunning‚Äù
by this stage), they stayed in place throughout.</p>

<p>Socks can make a big difference on a long run, so I can happily report
back that the two pairs I tried, from
<a href="http://www.lululemon.co.uk/p/men-socks/The-Sock/_/prod7680036?rcnt=4&amp;N=7s6&amp;cnt=7&amp;color=LM9539S_0002">Lululemon</a>{.u-underline}
and
<a href="https://www.inov-8.com/men/accessories/socks/speed-sock-mid-black">Inov8</a>{.u-underline},
were light, snug and comfortable throughout. They did a 12-hour shift
each with no problems, no blisters, no rubbing, which I would say is
highly commendable.</p>

<p>Of course, on a long run, the vital piece of kit is the shoes. I brought
three pairs along with me with the plan to change them occasionally so
my feet weren‚Äôt spending 24-hours running on the same surface in the
same shape shoe.</p>

<p>I started with my favourite running shoe of the moment, <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_gb/brooks-hyperion-mens-running-shoes/110234.html">the Brooks
Hyperion</a>{.u-underline}.
I use these to train in and love the lightweight feel. They also seem to
have a nice, soft touch on the ground, even when you are running on the
road. Some shoes seem to make a sharp slapping sound when you run, which
always make me feel like I‚Äôm doing it wrong. But in these I feel light
and smooth. Of course, being racing flats, these aren‚Äôt really designed
to be worn for more than a few hours, so I knew that, after a while, I
would need to switch to something with a bit more cushioning.</p>

<p>Next up were the <a href="https://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/pd/air-zoom-pegasus-34-running-shoe/pid-11827243/pgid-12169865">Nike Air Zoom Pegasus
34</a>{.u-underline}.
These are a classic shoe and I felt as though I was stepping into a
tried and tested product when I pulled them on, like when you get into
an expensive car and everything feels comfortable and sleek. The shoes
felt plush, and they looked good, too (I had the fetching pale blue
edition). ‚ÄúAlmost good enough to eat,‚Äù one of my fellow runners
commented as he went by, eyeing them admiringly.</p>

<p>Hoka Clayton 2.
But these, too, are not designed to be run in for ever. I managed four
hours before my feet were ready for the final pair. If any of the kit I
tested was actually designed for such a race, it was the <a href="https://www.ultramarathonrunningstore.com/Hoka-CLAYTON-2-Road-Running-Shoes-p/hokaclaytontwo.htm">Hoka Clayton
2</a>{.u-underline}.
I‚Äôve always been a minimalist runner at heart, but I‚Äôve done a few
ultras recently, and I always end up with sore feet, looking jealously
at those people bouncing along in Hokas. So, I thought I would give them
a try.</p>

<p>As well as the ample cushioning ‚Äì which six hours into the race, I was
very happy with ‚Äì they also had space for my swelling feet to expand
into. I did get a pair half a size too big, which helped, but they are
intentionally wide with a big toebox to allow your feet to expand on
landing as they will naturally want to do. Four hours later, I tried
switching back to the other shoes for a bit, but I soon realised that,
after 12 hours running, there was only one pair of shoes I could wear
and that was the Hokas. So they quickly came back on and stayed on until
the end.</p>

<p>At which point I collapsed in a heap on the ground, my batteries well
and truly drained.</p>
