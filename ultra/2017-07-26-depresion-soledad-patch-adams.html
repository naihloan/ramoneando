<p>Una alumna del CAE escribe sobre payamédicos y me acuerdo de patch adams. Busco algunas fuentes originales y encuentro dos gracias. Una, es que hay película de bollywood (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374887/">Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.</a>), que muchas son excelentes. Dos, citas impactantes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>The medical professionals are a lot more comfortable calling it &quot;depression&quot; than calling it &quot;loneliness.&quot;</em><br> &quot;Conferenza con Patch Adams a Reggio Emilia&quot; arcoiris tv (27 March 2008)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>I think my government are fascists. I feel that if we don't change from a society that worships money and power over to one that worships compassion and generosity, there is no hope for human survival this century.</em><br> As quoted in &quot;Entrevista com o médico americano P. Adams&quot; in Roda Viva - Entrevista (13 November 2007)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>You know, it's always the same. I've clowned in 81 countries. People hunger for love, and clowning is a trick to get love close. As a clown I can do things that people are too frightened of Love to allow you to do.</em><br> As quoted in &quot;Patch Adams and clowns spreading laughter at hospital&quot; (2 March 2016)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>Any can do it — BE RADIANT! Make the decision. I want to be an agent of change to a loving world — so I will be radiant.</em><br> As quoted in &quot;Patch Adams and clowns spreading laughter at hospital&quot; (2 March 2016)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p><em>I'll give you an example — in Russia most of the hospitals don't have any pain medicine, they don't have any money. So if you're with kids with cancer, they can have metastases to the bone; which some say is the worst pain a human can experience. So a mother can be in a room with a child who hasn't stopped screaming in five months. ...85% of the time I walk in there as a clown they'll stop screaming.</em><br> As quoted in &quot;Entrevista com o médico americano P. Adams&quot; in Roda Viva - Entrevista (13 November 2007)</p>
