<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<p>On last race I decided to focus on the mental aspect of preparation so at least the night prior to the event I simply left all electronic devices early in the previous day, at sunset. Later on I find that this de clutter, digital detox, is not something that would occur to me alone but could rather become a trend, to fit in a less consumer type of life, more minimalist, and found so on a youtube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z8_YhWoq2o">I quit social media for 30 days, by Matt D'Avella | 5 nov. 2018</a>. Also, he suggests how to keep things in order: which saves time and helps productivity. And: it is not only about throwing things away but also creating new habits to follow daily and keep up with new things incoming. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAtHvlPViJo">Decluttering for Messy People</a>.</p>
