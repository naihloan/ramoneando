<blockquote>
<p>When the child was a child,<br />
it walked with its arms swinging.<br />
it wanted the stream to be a river, the river a torrent,<br />
and this puddle to be the sea.<br />
When the child was a child, it didn't know it was a child.<br />
Everything was full of life, and all life was one.<br />
When the child was a child,<br />
it had no opinion about anything, no habits.<br />
it often sat cross-legged, took off running,<br />
had a cowlick in its hair,<br />
and didn't make faces when photographed.</p>
