<blockquote>
<p>Bad hand / soul obstacles &gt; write journal with dirty laundry. shape pain to flip it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your bad hand?</p>
<p>What are the current factors limiting your growth and success? Is someone standing in your way at work or school? Are you underappreciated and overlooked for opportunities? What are the long odds you’re up against right now? Are you standing in your own way?”</p>
<p>“Break out your journal (...) Don’t be bland with this assignment. I showed you every piece of my dirty laundry. If you were hurt or are still in harm’s way, tell the story in full. Give your pain shape. Absorb its power, because you are about to flip that shit.</p>
<p>You will use your story, this list of excuses, these very good reasons why you shouldn’t amount to a damn thing, to fuel your ultimate success. Sounds fun right? Yeah, it won’t be. (...) For now, just take inventory.</p>
<p>Once you have your list, share it with whoever you want. (...) writing out a few lines about how your own past or present circumstances challenge you to the depth of your soul. Otherwise, acknowledge and accept it privately. Whatever works for you. I know it’s hard, but this act alone will begin to empower you to overcome.</p>

<h3 id="challenge-2">CHALLENGE #2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>abolish the ego. post-its with dreams + goals + steps. accountability &amp; self-discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This is not a self-love tactic. You can’t fluff it. Don’t massage your ego. This is about abolishing the ego and taking the first step toward becoming the real you!</p>
<p>I tacked Post-It notes on my Accountability Mirror, and I’ll ask you to do the same. Digital devices won’t work. Write all your insecurities, dreams, and goals on Post-Its and tag up your mirror. (...) Own it! It’s okay to be unkind with yourself in these moments because we need thicker skin to improve in life.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a career goal (quit my job, start a business), a lifestyle goal (lose weight, get more active), (...) you need to be truthful with yourself about where you are and the necessary steps it will take to achieve those goals, day by day. Each step, each necessary point of self-improvement, should be written as its own note. That means you have to do some research and break it all down. For example, if you are trying to lose forty pounds, your first Post-It may be to lose two pounds in the first week. Once that goal is achieved, remove the note and post the next goal of two to five pounds until your ultimate goal is realized.</p>
<p>Whatever your goal, you’ll need to hold yourself accountable for the small steps it will take to get there. Self-improvement takes dedication and self-discipline. The dirty mirror you see every day is going to reveal the truth. Stop ignoring it. Use it to your advantage.</p>

<h3 id="challenge-3">CHALLENGE #3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>write good things that you don't do. do &amp; repeat. micro level of doing something that sucks. simple &gt; increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step on the journey toward a calloused mind is stepping outside your comfort zone on a regular basis. (...) write down all the things you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable. Especially those things you know are good for you.</p>
<p>Now go do one of them, and do it again.</p>
<p>(...) there is no need for you to find your own impossible task and achieve it on the fast track. This is not about changing your life instantly, it’s about moving the needle bit by bit and making those changes sustainable. That means digging down to the micro level and doing something that sucks every day. Even if it’s as simple as (...) getting up before dawn and running two miles each day. Once that becomes comfortable, take it to five, then ten miles. If you already do all those things, find something you aren’t doing. (...) Find something you aren’t doing. (...) We often choose to focus on our strengths rather than our weaknesses. Use this time to make your weaknesses your strengths.</p>
<p>Doing things—even small things—that make you uncomfortable will help make you strong. The more often you get uncomfortable the stronger you’ll become, and soon you’ll develop a more productive, can-do dialogue with yourself in stressful situations.</p>

<p>turn tables by excellence [bill and ted's bogus journey] surpass ideal maximum standard expectation. use negativity</p>

<p>Choose any competitive situation that you’re in right now. Who is your opponent? (...) No matter how they’re treating you there is one way to not only earn their respect, but turn the tables. Excellence.</p>
<p>(...) work harder (...) Do everything exactly as they ask, and whatever standard they set as an ideal outcome, you should be aiming to surpass that.</p>
<p>If your coach doesn’t give you time in the games, dominate practice. (...) You need to make that coach pay attention.”</p>
<p>“If it’s your teacher, then start doing work of high quality. (...) surpass their maximum expectations.</p>
<p>Whoever you’re dealing with, your goal is to make them watch you achieve what they could never have done themselves. (...) Take their negativity and use it to dominate their task with everything you’ve got. (...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VISUALIZE | less words, more image of success &amp; potential challenges. why? darkness? answers for wall time! matter <em>and</em> mind. relentless schedule. at the end, other life. victory is not 1st place, but surmounting obstacle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s time to visualize! Again, the average person thinks 2,000–3,000 thoughts per hour. Rather than focusing on bullshit you cannot change, imagine visualizing the things you can. (...) I start by painting a picture of what my success looks and feels like. I’ll think about it every day (...)</p>
<p>But visualization isn’t simply about daydreaming of some trophy ceremony—real or metaphorical. You must also visualize the challenges that are likely to arise and determine how you will attack those problems (...) When I show up for a foot race now, I drive the entire course first, visualizing success but also potential challenges, which helps me control my thought process. (...)</p>
<p>That also means being prepared to answer the simple questions. Why are you doing this? What is driving you toward this achievement? Where does the darkness you’re using as fuel come from? What has calloused your mind? You’ll need to have those answers at your fingertips when you hit a wall of pain and doubt. (...)</p>
<p>Remember, visualization will never compensate for work undone. You cannot visualize lies. All the strategies I employ to answer the simple questions and win the mind game are only effective because I put in work. It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, (...) at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“This challenge doesn’t have to be physical, and victory doesn’t always mean you came in first place. (...) overcome a lifelong fear or any other obstacle (...)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Take inventory of your Cookie Jar. Crack your journal open again. Write it all out. Remember, this is not some breezy stroll through your personal trophy room. Don’t just write down your achievement hit list. Include life obstacles you’ve overcome as well, (...) Feel what it was like to overcome those struggles, those opponents, and win.

<blockquote>
<p>Remove brain. Push past normal 5/10%. increase more run, adapting preventing injury. resetting baseline. mental strength and confidence (...) life is one big mind game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main objective here is to slowly start to remove the governor from your brain.</p>
<p>First, a quick reminder of how this process works. In 1999, when I weighed 297 pounds, my first run was a quarter mile. Fast forward to 2007, I ran 205 miles in thirty-nine hours, nonstop. I didn’t get there overnight, and I don’t expect you to either. Your job is to push past your normal stopping point.</p>
<p>Whether you are running on a treadmill or doing a set of push-ups, get to the point where you are so tired and in pain that your mind is begging you to stop. Then push just 5 to 10 percent further. (...) If you normally run thirty miles each week, run 10 percent more next week.</p>
<p>This gradual ramp-up will help prevent injury and allow your body and mind to slowly adapt to your new workload. It also resets your baseline, which is important because you’re about to increase your workload another 5 to 10 percent the following week, and the week after that resets your baseline, which is important because you’re about to increase your workload another 5 to 10 percent the following week, and the week after that.</p>
<p>There is so much pain and suffering involved in physical challenges that it’s the best training to take command of your inner dialogue, and the newfound mental strength and confidence you gain by continuing to push yourself physically will carry over to other aspects in your life. You will realize that if you were underperforming in your physical challenges, there is a good chance you are underperforming at school and work too.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that life is one big mind game. The only person you are playing against is yourself. Stick with this process and soon what you thought was impossible will be something you do every fucking day of your life.</p>

<p>SCHEDULE | 3 week challenge. <em>only work on one thing at a time. relentlessly.</em><br />
1. compartmentalize + timestamps. 4/5 hs loss! see + use &gt; increased productivity. optimal schedule!!! 15-30 mins blocks. no open ends. rest, brain too. no bullshit social media nor emails.<br />
2. week two. find residual dead space.<br />
3. week three, you should have a working schedule that maximizes your effort without sacrificing sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schedule it in!</p>
<p>It’s time to compartmentalize your day. Too many of us have become multitaskers, and that’s created a nation of half-asses. This will be a three-week challenge. During week one, go about your normal schedule, but take notes. When do you work? Are you working nonstop or checking your phone (the Moment app will tell you)? How long are your meal breaks? When do you exercise, watch TV, or chat to friends? How long is your commute? Are you driving? I want you to get super detailed and document it all with timestamps. This will be your baseline, and you’ll find plenty of fat to trim. Most people waste four to five hours on a given day, and if you can learn to identify and utilize it, you’ll be on your way toward increased productivity.</p>
<p>In week two, build an optimal schedule. Lock everything into place in fifteen- to thirty-minute blocks. Some tasks will take multiple blocks or entire days. Fine. When you work,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>only work on one thing at a time,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>think about the task in front of you and pursue it relentlessly. When it comes time for the next task on your schedule, place that first one aside, and apply the same focus.</p>
<p>Make sure your meal breaks are adequate but not open-ended, and schedule in exercise and rest too. But when it’s time to rest, actually rest. No checking email or bullshitting on social media. If you are going to work hard you must also rest your brain.</p>
<p>Make notes with timestamps in week two. You may still find some residual dead space. By week three, you should have a working schedule that maximizes your effort without sacrificing sleep. Post photos of your schedule, with the hashtags</p>

<p>unusual motherfucker. overachiever. that greatness shit evaporates like a flash! focus and balance. <em>Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you. Continue to put obstacles in front of yourself, find the friction</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one’s for the unusual motherfuckers in this world. A lot of people think that once they reach a certain level of status, respect, or success, that they’ve made it in life. I’m here to tell you that you always have to find more. Greatness is not something that if you meet it once it stays with you forever. That shit evaporates like a flash of oil in a hot pan.</p>
<p>(...) Believe me, this is not for everyone because it will demand singular focus and may upset the balance in your life.</p>
<p>That’s what it takes to become a true overachiever, (...) It’s easy to stand out amongst everyday people and be a big fish in a small pond. It is a much more difficult task when you are a wolf surrounded by wolves.</p>
<p>This means not only getting into Wharton Business School, but being ranked #1 in your class. It means not just graduating BUD/S, but becoming Enlisted Honor Man in Army Ranger School then going out and finishing Badwater.</p>
<p>Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you, your coworkers, and teammates in that rare air. Continue to put obstacles in front of yourself, because that’s where you’ll find the friction that will help you grow even stronger. Before you know it, you will stand alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FAIL! The fuck be it! After Action Report [AAR]. Be generous. Be brutal. Mindset short? Take the pain. Repeat. Preparation, training, execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about your most recent and your most heart-wrenching failures. Break out that journal one last time. Log off the digital version and write them out long-hand. I want you to feel this process because you are about to file your own, belated After Action Reports.</p>
<p>First off, write out all the good things, everything that went well, from your failures. Be detailed and generous with yourself. A lot of good things will have happened. It’s rarely all bad. Then note how you handled your failure. Did it affect your life and your relationships? How so?</p>
<p>How did you think throughout the preparation for and during the execution stage of your failure? You have to know how you were thinking at each step because it’s all about mindset, and that’s where most people fall short.</p>
<p>Now go back through and make a list of things you can fix. This isn’t time to be soft or generous. Be brutally honest, write them all out. Study them. Then look at your calendar and schedule another attempt as soon as possible. If the failure happened in childhood, and you can’t recreate the Little League all-star game you choked in, I still want you to write that report because you’ll likely be able to use that information to achieve any goal going forward.</p>
<p>As you prepare, keep that AAR handy, consult your Accountability Mirror, and make all necessary adjustments. When it comes time to execute, keep everything we’ve learned about the power of a calloused mind, the Cookie Jar, and The 40% Rule in the forefront of your mind. Control your mindset. Dominate your thought process. This life is all a fucking mind game. Realize that. Own it!</p>
<p>And if you fail again, so the fuck be it. Take the pain. Repeat these steps and keep fighting. That’s what it’s all about. Share your stories from preparation, training, and execution on social media with the hashtags</p>
