<p>I notice that a guy running has the same upper clothing than I do: a black long sleeved shirt underneath of a brilliant yellow short one. The combination is given for me by a combination of my desire to be visible with colors at dusk, as well as an extra new layer of cloth with the first cold temperature of this autumn.</p>
<p>I can't avoid thinking that I did this intuitively by looking outside the window and stepping a moment to the balcony before heading out. Perhaps many people have this process automatized by schedule and by checking on the climate channel/app or even have all set by other parameters.</p>
