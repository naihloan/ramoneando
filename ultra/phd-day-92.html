<li>Sociological Fiction. What about a parallel world in which negroes ruled the world? Perhaps that would not be another place, but perhaps just another timeline. Being white would be oppresed.

<p>Kusch had his toll in favor of the candidness of the familiar expression <em>negra</em> for family and beloved ones. Afro music would break through the world with beats, natural instruments, and the appreciation for live (not recorded nor replayable) music that doesn't need to be songs from start to finish but rather states of mind and being.</p>

<li>Obama tells a tale on how social media gives bias to all viewers: a not scientific experiment --but an experiment at low scale anyhow-- checked on a conservative, a liberal, and a moderate. And asked them to check on the events of a specific place under civil war, under the browser of their normal use, and they would just simply put the name of the place. The 1st sees crisis among the search results, the 2nd sees social liberation, and the 3rd sees vacation opportunities.</li>
