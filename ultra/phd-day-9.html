<p>&quot;Perhaps the genius of ultrarunning is its supreme lack of utility. It makes no sense in a world of space ships and supercomputers to run vast distances on foot. There is no money in it and no fame, frequently not even the approval of peers. But as poets, apostles and philosophers have insisted from the dawn of time, there is more to life than logic and common sense. The ultra runners know this instinctively. And they know something else that is lost on the sedentary. They understand, perhaps better than anyone, that the doors to the spirit will swing open with physical effort. In running such long and taxing distances they answer a call from the deepest realms of their being -- a call that asks who they are ...&quot; - David Blaikie</p>
<p>6/12/05 addition(s): &quot;Pushing your body past what you thought it was capable of is easy; the hard part is pushing yourself even further ... past what your mind wants to let you. That’s what ultrarunning is all about; introducing you to a self you’ve never known.<br />

<h2 id="gross-but-accomplished">GROSS but ACCOMPLISHED</h2>
<p>&quot;I wasn’t a truly genuine trail ultrarunner until March 7, 1992 at the Wild Oak 50 near Harrisonburg, Virginia. It was a rainy day and simultaneously, while I was piddling on the run, chewing on an energy bar and washing it down with Mountain Dew, my nose was dripping and I farted. That was the ultimate defining moment in my trail running career, if not my entire life.&quot; - Bob Boeder</p>
<h2 id="pushi-ng-more">PUSHI NG MORE</h2>
<p>&quot;If you run hard, there's the pain -- and you've got to work your way through the pain ... You know, lately it seems all you hear is 'Don't overdo it' and 'Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull. If you push the human body, it will respond.&quot; -Bob Clarke, NHL Hall of Famer</p>

<p>&quot;You're not puking and nothing's broken so get going.&quot; - Vivian McQueeney to her husband, Scott, in the middle of the climb to Whitney Portal during Badwater 2000</p>
<p>&quot;The luxurious ache of tired but not weary limbs.&quot; - Michael Fairless, 'The Roadmender'.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&quot; - Theodore Roosevelt, Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910</p>
<h2 id="piss-and-fart.-and-laugh">PISS AND FART. AND LAUGH</h2>
<p>&quot;Just go out there and simutaneously piss in your shorts, fart like a foghorn and drink from your mud-caked bottle. While you're at it let some liquid dribble down your chin onto your shirt, look up at the starry night and laugh like a raving lunatic. Fook em all. You're doing what you love to do and no one can stop you.&quot; - Michael Musca, as told to Will Brown</p>
<p>&quot;You guys just shuffle from concession stand to concession stand!&quot; - Helge Zimmet, said to Karen Claire at <em>Way Too Cool</em></p>

<h2 id="run-fast.-let-go.-box-like-muhammed-ali">RUN FAST. LET GO. BOX LIKE MUHAMMED ALI</h2>
<p>&quot;Running fast requires conditioning your body, absorbing proper mechanics to the point where they're second nature, and then forgetting the details and letting it rip. It may sound funny to someone who hasn't been there, but the more you can let go, the faster you can go. Look at films of Mohammad Ali in his prime and you'll see how he had that little wrist flick on the end of his jab; if he had to think about doing that, he couldn't have done it. People have things inside them they don't know about until it comes out. When somebody asks me how fast a human being can run, I tell them that however fast they think it is, it'll be faster.&quot; - John Smith, UCLA track coach</p>
<h2 id="wild-life">WILD LIFE</h2>

<h2 id="common-sense.-own-pace">COMMON SENSE. OWN PACE</h2>
<p>&quot;Common sense is necessary ... more so than high tech. Race to the finish not race from the start, pace yourself, run your own race and don't get sucked into someone else's, walk when you need too, run when you can, eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we will hurt.&quot; - Kevin Sayers</p>
<h2 id="scale-of-animals.-hamsters-and-deers">SCALE OF ANIMALS. HAMSTERS and DEERS</h2>
<p>&quot;I love running cross-country ... You come up a hill and see two deer going: 'What the hell is he doing?' On a track, I feel like a hamster.&quot; - Robin Williams, film star/comic/runner</p>
<h2 id="brain-change">BRAIN CHANGE</h2>
<p>&quot;When you are 99 miles into a 100-mile running race, your brain is not the same brain you started with&quot;. - Paul Huddle</p>

<h2 id="decide-beforehand">DECIDE BEFOREHAND</h2>
<p>&quot;Decide before the race the conditions that will cause you to stop and drop out. You don't want to be out there saying, Well gee, my leg hurts, I'm a little dehydrated, I'm sleepy, I'm tired, and its cold and windy. And talk yourself into quitting. If you are making a decision based on how you feel at that moment, you will probably make the wrong decision.&quot; - Dick Collins</p>
<h2 id="sleep-later.-no-quit.">SLEEP LATER. NO QUIT.</h2>
<p>&quot;The Quitter&quot; When you're lost on the trail with the speed of a snail And defeat looks you straight in the eye And you're needing to sit, your whole being says quit You're certain it's your time to die. But the code of the trail is &quot;move forward don't fail&quot; Though your knees and ego are scarred. All the swelling and pain is just part of the game In the long run it's quitting that's hard!</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sick of the pain!&quot; Well, now, that's a shame But you're strong, you're healthy, and bright. So you've had a bad stretch and you're ready to retch, Shoulders back, move forward, and fight. It's the plugging away that will win you the day, Now don't be a loser my friend! So the goal isn't near, why advance to the rear. All struggles eventually end.</p>
<p>It's simple to cry that your finished; and die. It's easy to whimper and whine. Move forward and fight, though there's no help in sight You'll soon cross the lost finish line. You'll come out of the black, with the wind at your back, As the clouds start to part; there's the sun. Then you'll know in your heart, as you did at the start. You're not a quitter.

If you did know, it would not be a test; and there would be no reason for being there.&quot; - Dan Baglione</p>

<h2 id="good-spirit">Good Spirit</h2>

<h2 id="normality">Normality</h2>
<p>&quot;The number of miles I have run since I was a toddler would have taken me around the world several times, and I still cannot define precisely my joy in running. There is no sacrifice in it. I lead what I regard a normal life. In my case, I thoroughly enjoy running 100-odd miles a week. If I didn't I wouldn't do it. Who can define happiness?

<h2 id="admire-challenge">Admire Challenge</h2>
<p>&quot;The people that I have met are not foolish; they are aware of how tired and cold and hungry and frightened and hurting and discouraged and disoriented and how possibly injured they will become. They know they will face great physical, mental, emotional, and possibly spiritual challenges as they make their way to the finish. This is what they are racing against. This is their challenge. This is what I admire.&quot; - Carolyn Erdman</p>

<p>&quot;Enjoy your pain, you earned it!&quot; - Pauli Kiriu</p>
<h2 id="run-an-ultra-on-concentration">Run an ultra on Concentration</h2>

<p>&quot;It's very hard in the beginning to understand that the whole idea is not to beat the other runners. Eventually you learn that the competition is against the little voice inside you that wants you to quit.&quot; - George Sheehan</p>

<p><em>&quot;When you run there are no mistakes, only lessons. The art and science of ultrarunning is a process of trial, error and experimentation. The failed experiments are as much a part of the process as the combination that ultimately works.&quot;</em> - Keith Pippin</p>

<p>&quot;Some think guts is sprinting at the end of a race. But guts is what got you there to begin with. Guts start back in the hills with 6 miles to go and you're thinking of how you can get out of this race without anyone noticing. Guts begin when you still have forty minutes of torture left and you're already hurting more than you ever remember.&quot; - George Sheehan</p>

<p>&quot;If you start to feel good during an Ultra, don't worry - you'll get over it.&quot; - Gene Thibeault</p>
<p>&quot;Once that distance had been passed in training, an important physical and psychological threshold had been crossed. It was no longer a question of <em>if</em> it could be done. Rather, it became a question of <em>how fast</em> it could be done.&quot; - Mike Plant (about Dave Scott)</p>
<p>&quot;Self-conquest is the greatest of victories.&quot; - Plato</p>

<p>&quot;I never met a carbohydrate I didn't like.&quot; - David Lygre</p>

<p>&quot;Never look back, someone might be gaining on you&quot; - Satchel Paige</p>
<p>&quot;The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection.&quot; - Thomas Paine</p>
<p>&quot;Each time you run you will receive lessons. You have enrolled in the school of ultrarunning. You may like the lessons or think them irrelevant and stupid. What you think makes no difference; the lessons will be presented until they are learned.&quot; - Keith Pippin</p>
<p>&quot;If the bone's not showin', just keep goin'!&quot; - Joan Risse at Angeles Crest, 9/95</p>
<p>&quot;Happy trails to you, until we meet again&quot; - Roy Rogers and Dale Evans</p>
<p>&quot;You must do the thing you think you cannot do.&quot; - Eleanor Roosevelt</p>
<p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who at the worst, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&quot; - Teddy Roosevelt</p>
<p>&quot;I had as many doubts as anyone else. Standing on the starting line, we're all cowards.&quot; - Alberto Salazar</p>
<p>&quot;Sweetness and release can only taste the way they do after one deserves them.&quot; - Shapiro</p>
<p>&quot;The body is given out on loan - don't waste it and expect to use it tomorrow.&quot; - Shapiro</p>
<p>&quot;A dozen extra steps becomes a tremendous aggravation when you are pushing your edge out hour after hour.&quot; - Shapiro</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy the training and memories of race day, endure the race.&quot; - Shapiro</p>
<p>&quot;I have met my hero, and he is me.&quot; - George Sheehan</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever felt worse after a run?&quot; - George Sheehan</p>
<p>&quot;Success rests in having the courage and endurance, and above all, the will to become the person you are. . . &quot; - George Sheehan</p>
<p>&quot;I won't last forever, but I'm damn well going to know that I was here!&quot; - George Sheehan</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is more certain than the defeat of a man who gives up.&quot; - George Sheehan</p>
<p>&quot;ARRRGH -- what in God's name ever possessed me to think this would be a good thing to do?&quot; - Charles N. Steele</p>
<p>&quot;I never met a hill I couldn't walk.&quot; - Larry Stice</p>
<p>&quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.&quot; - Alfred Lord Tennyson</p>
<p>&quot;I have to find another port-a-tree.&quot; - Ellie Thayer</p>
<p>&quot;It's the quitting that really is hard.&quot; - Gene Thibeault</p>
<p>&quot;People think ultra is some kind of spaghetti eating contest for people with no talent to do anything else. But there's a lot going on. I break it down into the physical, the mental and endurance. Physical is the only gender-specific area; men have more muscle mass, the strongest man is always going to be stronger than the strongest woman. But I think physical is only a small percentage of ultra. The mental part includes preparation, strategizing, problem solving. How do you deal with 22 miles through snow, then overheating? How do you avoid allowing someone to lure you into running their race? You have to learn how to run over rocks downhill without trashing your quads; it's like skiing or dancing. And then endurance. An ultra is not about pain - I think a marathon is about pain, about intensity - but it's about hanging in through tiredness and about staying nutritionally fueled. There is some evidence that women may use fat more efficiently. And you have to want it, you have to have the passion, you have to be willing to take the risks. You can never be sure you'll finish.&quot; - Ann Trason</p>
<p>&quot;Any race you can walk away from, is a bad race&quot; - Coach Pete Waters</p>
<p>&quot;You'll have no trouble keeping up. Remember, I'm a 35 minute miler.&quot; (when discussing a training run) - Mark Williams, first of 253 people to finish Barkley 100</p>
<p>&quot;If I can see it, I can run to it.&quot; - Randi Bromka Young</p>
<p>&quot;If you get tired on a trail run, lie down in the middle of the trail in such a way that no one could pass you without waking you up - it will insure your finish line position.&quot; - Glen Zirbel</p>
<p>&quot;If you can dream it, you can do it.&quot; - Angeles Crest motto</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;May the road rise up to greet you, and the wind always be at your back&quot;</em> - Irish proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;For yesterday is but a dream, And tomorrow is only a vision, But today well-lived makes Every yesterday a dream of happiness, and every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore, to this day! Such is the salutation of the dawn.&quot; - from &quot;The Sanskrit&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The pain is temporary, The pride lasts forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you can't learn anything from losing, don't lose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always enjoy yourself. Never give up. Don't think of being tired. Keep on going until you cross the finish line. Don't be upset if you don't win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stick a fork in me, I'm done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, dear, I hope you know what you're doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look honey, here comes one that's still running!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adversity introduces a man to himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The finish line is just ahead.&quot; &quot;The aid station is just ahead.&quot; &quot;Trust me ... this is the last hill.&quot; &quot;You're almost there.&quot; &quot;The trail is well marked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we do what we did yesterday, we'll be OK. If we do something new we'll be competetive. If we are always looking for new and innovative ways of doing things then we will be the best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's easy to imagine how you will act when things go according to plan, that's why you must always prepare yourself for what you will do when they don't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The finishing line isn't given; it is earned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fear, like pain, may only be God's way ... of hurting us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The amount of time the body needs to recuperate is not a sign of weakness but a fact of life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A pounding heart is a sure sign you are putting forth your best effort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no future if we only repeat the past.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing beats experience.&quot;</p>
