<p>This panel asks how STS can combine with heterodox economics to provide
new directions for Responsible Innovation. It uses Responsible
Stagnation as a lens through which to consider questions relative to the
governance of &#8216;innovation&#8217; in a world of finite resources and fragile
ecosystems.</p>

<h4 id="longabstract">Long abstract</h4>

<p>Responsible Innovation (RI) was originally conceived as a way of
mediating the crisis-driven demand for economic growth by shaping
high-tech innovation towards filling social needs rather than merely
generating profit. However, as RI has become embedded in science,
technology and innovation (STI) policies, it has become subsumed into
the same growth-driven paradigms it was originally meant to challenge.
Accepting that productivity in advanced economies has reached that
steady state in which returns from increased input are diminishing, we
therefore suggest an exploration of Responsible Stagnation (RS) as an
integral and neglected part of the discussion of RI. This panel seeks
papers which explore the idea that to be responsible to the future,
innovation must take place in an enabling economic framework that
respects planetary limitations and sustains social progress. What kinds
of &#8216;innovation&#8217; should be encouraged in advanced economies which are
effectively stagnant in terms of wages and social improvement, and how
may &#8216;filling social needs&#8217; be better measured than mere increase in GDP?
Under what conditions can innovation which leads to stagnation in
consumption of non-renewable resources become a desirable economic goal?
Heterodox economists have asked similar questions but have not engaged
with STS as a means of understanding the co-production of technology and
social relations to further their aims. We hence invite papers that
explore how heterodox economics can combine with STS to provide fruitful
new directions for RI. We welcome both theoretical and empirical
contributions.</p>

<p>Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in turbulent times: how the
British broader political context is shaping the RRI practices of the
Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC)</p>

<p><em>Authors</em>:¬†Mario Pansera (University of Bristol)¬†</p>

<h4 id="shortabstract">Short abstract</h4>

<p>This paper focuses on the evolution of the EPSRC&#8217;s engagement with
Responsible Innovation (RI). The work shows that the changing political
environment for research and higher education in the UK, including
Brexit, are seen as significant factors that could influence the future
of RI in the UK</p>

<h4 id="longabstract">Long abstract</h4>

<p>This paper focuses on the evolution of the EPSRC&#8217;s engagement with
Responsible Innovation (RI). Based on 20 interviews and document
analysis, we describe how the EPSRC moved from an approach to research
funding based on Public Engagement initiatives to the purposeful
embedding of RI within some its directed programmes. Despite the formal
commitment to RI, however, significant institutional and cultural
barriers remain. Disciplinary norms, approaches to epistemology,
institutional expectations, incentives and research evaluation criteria
are hindering uptake and practice of RI. Without changes to these,
proper resourcing and committed leadership, RI as an inter and
transdisciplinary endeavour faces major challenges. Our findings suggest
that the rising impact agenda in the UK presents an ongoing vehicle for
continued engagement with RI. However, overall it was felt that while
the UK academic and research council communities have played a major
contributing role in the development of RI in concept and practice, it
was acknowledged that it is a fragile discourse encountering significant
institutional barriers and uncertain political times. The changing
political environment for research and higher education in the UK,
including Brexit and the forthcoming transition of the UK Research
Councils transition into a new body (UK Research and Innovation) are
seen as significant factors that could influence the future of RI in the
UK. This is set in the context of an overwhelming political imperative
for economic growth at a government policy level, for example within its
Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>Pushing &#8216;responsible stagnation&#8217;: can scientists be agents of change?</p>

<h4 id="shortabstract">Short abstract</h4>

<p>In this talk my objective is to address the challenge of carving out a
space to engage with alternative economic frameworks within current
research and innovation practices, and ask the question of whether
scientists can serve as agents of change.</p>

<h4 id="longabstract">Long abstract</h4>

<p>The rise of RRI in European science policy can offer a unique moment to
actively engage with the underlying rationales of R&amp;D. What does it mean
to produce social goods? Who makes the decisions of what the public
needs? Such questions can challenge existing innovation narratives, and
elicit potential tensions between growth-driven paradigms and ideas
about sustainability and democratization. This kind of engagement
presupposes that we identify the sites and actors where disruptions can
be made meaningful. One such site that has been at focus for RRI
initiatives is the practices of scientists and their research projects.</p>

<p>This talk draws on three years of empirical research on bio- and
nanotechnology science practices, as well as analyses of RRI policy
discourses. Based on this empirical work my objective is to address the
challenge of carving out a space to actively engage with alternative
economic rationalities within the current framework of research and
innovation practices.</p>

<p>A key finding of this research points to the apparent incommensurability
of the interviewed scientists experiencing their daily research work as
mundane and far removed from bigger socio-political questions, while
mission-oriented research policies ascribe them a key role in solving
the economic and environmental challenges of our time. Thus, if an
objective of RRI is to challenge the rationales pushing R&amp;D, offering
alternative enabling economic frameworks such as &#8216;responsible
stagnation&#8217;, our attention as STS scholars also needs to be on the
coupling of such counter-narratives and the &#8216;mundanity&#8217; of daily
scientific practices.</p>

<p>Protecting and perfecting nature: performing responsibility in

<p>We analyse a multidisciplinary synthetic biology project and examine how
notions of environment and sustainability are mobilised by participants
to perform responsible innovation in the context of this
industry-academic collaboration.</p>

<h4 id="longabstract">Long abstract</h4>

<p>This paper presents analysis from a qualitative study of the field of
synthetic biology. Our study addresses how concepts of responsibility
are imagined and used by scientists working in an industry - academic
collaboration that is using synthetic biology approaches to address
industrial biotechnology challenges. The collaboration is motivated by
stated desires to shift from a petro-based to bio-based economy yet
wider questions on the relations of innovation and economy are not
raised.</p>

<p>Our analysis traces how ideas about futures, sustainability and
environments are mobilised by technical researchers to make sense of
their collaborative work; to provide a rationale for that work; and, to
distribute the responsibilities involved in the development of bio-based
industrial production strategies. We pay particular attention to the
role of such ideas in the practice and negotiation of the
academic-industry boundary. This site questions the relevance of
academic, experimental laboratory-based knowledge to the structures and
drivers of large-scale industrial bio-production and the political
imperative of a bio-based economy.</p>

<p>The study contributes to an examination of how ideas of responsible
research and innovation are experienced and framed in everyday
scientific practice.</p>

<p>Conceptualising the individual in the innovation discourse: implications

<h4 id="longabstract">Long abstract</h4>

<p>This work-in-progress research is exploring what happens when the
individual in the innovation discourse is framed from a specific
perspective of economic growth, and whether a broader perspective is
needed to expand our understanding of the impact of innovation in
development. It explores how, under a neoliberal paradigm, the
individual is conceptualized as a homo ≈ìconomicus, that is, rational,
risk-taking individuals seeking profit maximization, leaving little
considerations to social, cultural and institutional contexts of
entrepreneurship. This has implications in the conceptualisation of the
individual. For instance, in the development context, entrepreneurs are
believed to not only seek to maximize their own wealth, but also
empowerment and agency. This form of empowerment has an emphasis on
individual rationalities and self-sufficiency (Altan-Olcay, 2014)
Individuals therefore are expected to bear the responsibility to get
themselves out of poverty, notwithstanding broader structural and
institutional constraints. They are therefore either absent or treated
as self-interested economic rational being, a &#8220;one-dimensional&#8221; view of
the individual grounded in neoliberalism. We argue that a different
conception of individual agency is needed to understand innovation. The
theoretical framework is based in the Capability Approach, developed by
Amartya Sen.</p>
