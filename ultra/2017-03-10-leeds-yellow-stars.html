<h3>Urban inscription is not only about counter-culture, new voices spread through a whole country</h3>
<h4>The case of <em>Yellow Stars</em> as a legalized protest against deadly traffic accidents in Argentina</h4>

<hr>
<p>This presentation focuses on a specific type of urban intervention: painting of Yellow Stars in highways along the totality of Argentina wherever a mortal car accident had occurred. In the year 2008 a civil association began to protest in this specific way against the way people drive in Argentina and became legalized to execute painting under this cause.</p>
<p>The aim of attending to this case is to present a form of expression that is spreading, one that represents not a subculture but a larger social group, occupying the streets to claim a political or social debt from society, and that unify to come across a whole country. Between the years 2008 and 2017, over 10500 Stars have been painted through Argentina.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years graffiti has been associated to a myriad of themes, most of them counter-cultural, at least in their beginnings. The main topics graffiti has gone around include art, street culture, political protest and even anarchism. However, in the last years graffiti has become so ubiquitous that it causes a certain normalizing effect: the public already acknowledges that graffiti exists, and that it points city dwellers in a certain direction of attention, creating different types of subcultures and counter-cultural movements.</p>
<p>Urban signage on the other hand, has in general been controlled by the state. The social innovation in this case, is how citizens take hands in the matter to literally change how freeways and streets look like. Each time a driver or a passer-by goes through a non-statal &quot;Yellow Star&quot; he may act differently than if there were no signage at all. The presence of painted &quot;Yellow Stars&quot; is a claim of the public for order, in a order less environment. Hence, it is an urban intervention, graffiti, that goes beyond the classic political contents against specific government administrations, beyond art, and occupies the streets to defend an idea for a different society, with fewer deaths by car &quot;accidents&quot;.</p>
<p>Urban inscriptions can impulse social change, adaptation, and new ways of driving and walking on a large scale.</p>
