<h2 id="training-day">Training Day</h2>
<p>Today we didn't do a 20 mins back and forth to start and end the day. We just ran a calm 15 to begin, and then we went to the big staircases in the park, a near 150 mts distance. We were separated into 3 groups, some did it 8 times, others 14, and I did 10 with the girls and some guys a bit older: Flavia, Poli, Federico, Fernando and some others.</p>
<p>Good thing is that in a quick chat with Fernando he tells me that he wants to train for Marathon so he's planning on long runs on the weekends. This Saturday we may go together for a 16 kms stretch. Good to run in a group!</p>
