<h6 id="somethoughtsaboutthekindofeventswewanttoorganize">Some thoughts about the kind of events we want to organize</h6>

<p>Having done very different events - from tiny local DIY events to huge
ones like London Edinburgh London with its 1400+ participants - we have
developed a pretty clear idea about the kind of Audaxes/Brevets that we
want to put on. Taking the things we love about the rides we have done,
and trying to improve other aspects, here is a short list of things that
are important to us: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Not giving a shit about rankings]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We think Audaxes are challenging adventures and should not be races. The
challenge obviously is to finish within the given time limit. Beyond
that, we think your finishing time is utterly irrelevant. If
anything, arriving at the finishing line 5 minutes before the cut-off
time, completely empty, having spent the last bit of energy to still
make it, is the spirit we want to promote. Hence, we refuse to ever
create any rankings or acknowledge your placing in any form other than
writing it onto your brevet card
for [you] to know. ​​</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[A home on the road]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially on the longer brevets (600+) we think it&#8217;s important to have
at least one place along the road where you can sleep, get some warm
food and rest. Regardless whether you are a slower or fast rider, a home
on the road is always something to look forward to and makes such long
rides less intimidating. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Keeping things small]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are a small team and we want to make sure that our events are the
best possible experience for every rider. We therefore try to keep
things small and familiar, and not having too many participants. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Keep things affordable]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;ll try our best to keep our events affordable for everybody. We are a
non-profit organization which means that our entry fees allow us
to cover the costs of food, renting facilities and driving expenses. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Party! ]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We think one of the things that makes Audaxes/Brevets so special are the
people that do them and the experiences that are made along the
way. That&#8217;s why we organize dinner and drinks at the finishing line,
because we think it&#8217;s really nice to come together in the end, share
stories from the road, and let the experience sink in. Of course there
is no obligation and you are free to do whatever you like - but in any
case there is food and drink waiting for you!</p>
