SOPHIE: HI. YOU TWO OKAY?

BARBARA: UH... YEAH.

BARBARA: YEAH, AUSTIN WAS JUST EXPLAININ' STUFF TO ME, ABOUT THOTH AND HIS APE. THIS COMMUNICATION THEORY STUFF ABOUT SIGNAL AND NOISE.

BARBARA: AND, UH, WE HAD SEX.

BARBARA: I MEAN, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M UNFAITHFUL TO STEVE. IT'S JUST...

SOPHIE: BARBARA, IT'S FINE. I UNDERSTAND. DIFFERENT THINGS ARE IMPORTANT HERE.

AUSTIN: ARE THEY BUGGER.

AUSTIN: IT'S JUST THAT HERE YOU'RE NEAR ENOUGH TO YOUR EMOTIONS TO FEEL WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

AUSTIN: GOOD LUCK IN NETZACH, BARBARA. HOPE YOU FIND YOUR OLD MAN.

SOPHIE: YOU'RE NOT COMING WITH US?

AUSTIN: NO. THIS BIT OF ME BELONGS IN HOD.

AUSTIN: YOU'LL SEE ME LATER, DOWN THE ROAD, BUT I WON'T KNOW YOU. I'LL BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON THERE.

AUSTIN: TAKE CARE, GIRLS. DON'T GET OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.

SOPHIE: SO THAT'S AUSTIN OSMAN SPARE. HE'S SORT OF INTENSE, ISN'T HE?

BARBARA: SOPHIE, MAN, THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST £$%& I EVER HAD. I MEAN, NOT LOVE, BUT...

BARBARA: THERE WERE THESE SMEARY FACES BOILING ROUND HIS HEAD. AND I KEPT CHANGING. I WAS, LIKE, SIXTEEN OR SOMETHING. I...

BARBARA: I TELLYA, IT'S A GOOD JOB I'M ALREADY DEAD.

SOPHIE: MMM. I GUESS THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THIS SEVENTH, VENUSIAN SEPHIROTH.

SOPHIE: THERE BELOW THE ARCH IS THE VENUS SYMBOL, COMBINED WITH A FIGURE SEVEN... EVEN WITH THAT LITTLE CROSS ON THE BOTTOM.

SOPHIE: AND THERE'S THE HEBREW WORD NETZACH, WHICH MEANS "VICTORY."

BARBARA: I THOUGHT THIS SPHERE WAS ALL LOVE AND EMOTIONS AND LIKE THAT. HOW COME IT'S CALLED VICTORY?

SOPHIE: I DON'T KNOW. IT NEVER REALLY EXPLAINED THAT IN ANY OF THE BOOKS JACK FAUST LOANED ME.

SOPHIE: HEY, THIS LEADS STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE SURF. ARE WE SUPPOSED TO, LIKE, GO INTO THE WATER?

BARBARA: I GUESS. GOD, YOU SMELL ROSES? ME AND STEVE'S WEDDING, WE HAD THESE HEAVY, SCENTED ROSES...

SOPHIE: IT'S WARM. THE WATER'S WARM, LIKE BODY TEMPERATURE.

SOPHIE: MY MOM USED TO BATHE ME, WHEN I WAS A BABY. IT WAS...

SOPHIE: JESUS, I'M GETTING ALL CHOKED UP. WHAT IS THIS?

BARBARA: I KNOW. I CAN REMEMBER OUR FIRST HOUSE, HOW IT SMELLED WHEN WE MOVED IN. THE PAINT...

BARBARA: AH, #@*&...

SOPHIE: IT'S EMOTION. WATER IS EMOTION, ITS ELEMENT...

SOPHIE: BARBARA, I CAN'T STAY AFLOAT IN THIS. IT'S LIKE THERE'S A CURRENT...

BARBARA: YEAH. Y-YEAH, IT'S OKAY. IT'S NOT SO BAD. IF I DON'T THINK ABOUT STEVE, HOW HIS LAUGH SOUNDED, WATCHING SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE...

BARBARA: POOR, GREAT, JOHN BELUSHI...

BARBARA: S-SOPHIE?

BARBARA: SOPHIE, WHY AREN'T WE DROWNING? I CAN BREATHE AND TALK! IT'S LIKE BEING UNDERWATER IN A DREAM!

SOPHIE: THIS ISN'T WATER... OR IT'S WATER ON A SYMBOLIC LEVEL. WATER AS A SYMBOL OF EMOTION.

SOPHIE: AN OCEAN OF EMOTION.

BARBARA: YEAH...OR, WHAT WAS IT, IN YELLOW SUBMARINE? "A SEA OF GREEN."

BARBARA: HEY, WHAT'S THAT? IT LOOKS LIKE EMERALD...

SOPHIE: I THINK I SAW THIS IN A BOOK BY THAT LECHER CROWLEY. READ AROUND THE HEPTAGON, IT'S THE MAGICAL ORDER OF THE SEVEN CLASSICAL PLANETS.

SOPHIE: FOLLOW THE LINES OF THE HEPTAGRAM, AND IT'S THE DAYS OF THE WEEK...OR THE GODS THAT REPRESENT THEM.

SOPHIE: SEE? MONDAY'S THE MOON, TUESDAY'S THE MARTIAL GOD TIW, WEDNESDAY'S THE MAGIC-GOD WODEN, AND SO ON.

IN BACKGROUND: 3 9 4 8 5 7 6O

BARBARA: WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED. HOW MANY WEEKS WAS I ALIVE WITHOUT NOTICING THAT?

BARBARA: HEY, THINKIN' ABOUT IT, EVEN IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, IT'S THE GODS OF THE SAME SPHERES.

BARBARA: LIKE, WE HAVE WODEN'S DAY, WEDNESDAY...

BARBARA: ...AND THE FRENCH IS, WHAT, MERCREDI? MERCURY'S DAY?

SOPHIE: THAT'S RIGHT. AND WE HAVE FRIDAY, AFTER NORSE GODDESS FREYA, WHILE THE FRENCH HAVE VENDREDI, AFTER VENUS.

SOPHIE: I GUESS IT'S HERE BECAUSE THE SEVEN-POINTED STAR REPRESENTS THIS SEVENTH SPHERE.

ON BUBBLE: ..AND I'M SIXTEEN AND BOYS LOVE ME A LITTLE WHILE THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY ABOUT DOING ME THEY MEAN THEY LOVE ME  ..

BARBARA: YEAH. Y'KNOW, IT'S KINDA WEIRD. ORDINARY LIFE, IT'S GOT THESE ANCIENT SYMBOL SYSTEMS RUNNIN' ALL THROUGH IT, AND NOBODY EVEN THINKS ABOUT IT. IT'S...

BARBARA: ALL THE LOVE THERE'S EVER BEEN. SHE'S IT.

SOPHIE: AND SHE'S ENOUGH. AND EVERYTHING'S SAFE. JUST KNOWING THAT...

SOPHIE: ...IT'S SUCH A RELIEF.

BARBARA: YEAH.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, THIS IS BLISS. MY THOUGHTS, MY FEELINGS, THE WATER... EVERYTHING'S SO WARM AND DRIFTING AND PEACEFUL.

BARBARA: THIS SEA, IT'S LIKE TEARS, OR LIKE THE WOMB...

SOPHIE: MMMM. EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF THE WATER...

SOPHIE: EVERYTHING THAT'S ALIVE...

SOPHIE: ORGANISMS STRUGGLING AND REPRODUCING IN THIS RICH GREEN SOUP...

SOPHIE: AND THE WHOLE WORLD, EVERY SPECIES, RESULTS FROM THAT.

SOPHIE: THAT FIRST ATTRACTION.

SOPHIE: PARTICLES, ORGANISMS, PLANETS AND SUNS...IT'S ALL ABOUT ATTRACTION. IT'S HOW EVERYTHING HOLDS TOGETHER.

BARBARA: MMMM. THERE'S THAT VENUS SIGN AGAIN, THE PLANET SYMBOL.

BARBARA: AND THOSE JEWELS SET INTO IT. IT'S THAT THING. THAT KABELLAH THING...

SOPHIE: YES. THE TREE OF LIFE. AND VENUS IS THE ONLY PLANETARY SYMBOL THAT COMPLETELY REPRISES ITS SHAPE.

SOPHIE: THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS FOUNDED ON:

SOPHIE: LOVE.

BARBARA: MMMM.

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, EARLIER? THAT ROUGH CURRENT, UNTIL WE STOPPED FIGHTING IT? THAT'S HOW MY EMOTIONS ALWAYS USED TO BE. ALWAYS FIGHTING. ALWAYS REACTING.

BARBARA: I'D GET SCARED, OR ANGRY, OR DEPRESSED. ALL REACTIONS. I HARDLY GOT TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY OWN REAL FEELINGS WERE...

SOPHIE: YEAH. Y'KNOW, IT'S LIGHTER HERE. IT EVEN FEELS LIGHTER. WE MUST BE CLOSER TO THE...

SOPHIE: ...SURFACE...

BARBARA: -PFAHH-

BARBARA: WUOH...

BARBARA: DAMN. THAT WAS BUMPY.

BARBARA: SOPHIE? ARE YOU OKAY?

SOPHIE: -THFUHH-

SOPHIE: YEAH. NOT AS OKAY AS I WAS TWO MINUTES AGO, BUT I'M GOOD. I'M JUST NOT BLISSED OUT ANY MORE.

BARBARA: ME NEITHER.

BARBARA: GOD, THAT WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE, BEING DRAGGED AND THROWN AROUND BY MOODS AND FEELINGS...

BARBARA: ...BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST LIFE.

SOPHIE: YEAH.

SOPHIE: IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF WE HAVE EMOTIONS, OR IF EMOTIONS HAVE US.

SOPHIE: COME ON. LET'S HEAD UP THE BEACH.

BARBARA: SURE. SO, WHERE NEXT?

BARBARA: STEVE WASN'T HERE, OR IN THE LAST ZONE, THAT MERCURY SPHERE...

SOPHIE: I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO GO HIGHER.

BARBARA: YEAH? WELL, WHAT'S HIGHER THAN IMAGINATION OR INTELLIGENCE OR EMOTION?

BARBARA: SAY, IS THIS PLACE CHANGING COLOR?

SOPHIE: MM-HM. IT'S GETTING DARKER.

SOPHIE: AS FOR WHAT'S HIGHER...

SOPHIE: SEE, THERE'S OUR DREAMS, INTELLECT OR FEELINGS...AND THEN THERE'S THE SELF THAT HAS DREAMS, HAS A MIND, HAS FEELINGS.

SOPHIE: THE SELF IS HIGHER.

ON SIGN: ROUTE 24

SOPHIE: IT'S THE HIGHEST SELF. IT'S YOUR WILL. IT'S YOUR SOUL.

BARBARA: AND THIS HIGHWAY GOES THERE, RIGHT?

BARBARA: DOES IT HAVE A TAROT NAME?

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): YEAH.

BARBARA: DEATH?

BARBARA: SOPHIE, I ALREADY DIED. I--I REALLY DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

SOPHIE: RELAX. IN TAROT, DEATH IS JUST A METAPHOR.

SOPHIE: BEFORE PROGRESSING TO THE SOLAR SPHERE, THE HIGHEST SELF, IT'S LIKE OUR LOWER PERSONALITY... THE THING WE THINK OF AS US... HAS TO DIE.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): IT'S ALL OUR EARTHLY ATTACHMENTS, ALL OUR WORLDLY IDEAS AND PETTY EMOTIONS THAT ARE KILLED, SO THAT WE CAN CHANGE AND MOVE ON.

SOPHIE (OFF PANEL): CHANGE IS LIKE DEATH. IT'S SCARY, BUT IT'S NATURAL.

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): A-ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE! IT'S ALL CACTUS PLANTS AND BEETLES AND SCORPIONS...

SOPHIE: I GUESS THOSE ARE JUST THE MAGICAL PLANTS AND ANIMALS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PATH.

SOPHIE: HONESTLY, BARBARA, THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. ALL THIS MENACING IMAGERY, LIKE THE SKELETON WITH THE SCYTHE, IT'S JUST...

SOPHIE: ...SYMBO*

BARBARA: WH--

BARBARA (OFF PANEL): JEEZ...

BARBARA: Y'KNOW, THAT METAPHORICAL STUFF...

BARBARA: IT REALLY HURTS.

SOPHIE: Y-YEAH. SORT OF GETS THE IDEA ACROSS, THOUGH, DOESN'T IT?

SOPHIE: WE BETTER BE MOVING ON...

SOPHIE: THERE'S A WAY TO GO BEFORE MORNING.
