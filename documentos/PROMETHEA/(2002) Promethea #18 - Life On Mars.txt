BOO-BOO: WELL, YOU £$%&IN' PEOPLE, FOR ABOUT SIX BILLION.

BOO-BOO: BUT FORGET ANGER, OKAY? THAT'S JUST THE "STERN" PART OF WHAT THIS PLACE IS ALL ABOUT.

BOO-BOO: IT'S THE "JUDGMENT" BIT YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR £$%&IN' EYE ON.

SOPHIE: BUT...I MEAN, MARS SORT OF SYMBOLIZES ANGER.

BOO-BOO: NAH. YOU'RE THINKIN' OF GOOFY, THE PLANET OF TANTRUMS AND BRAWLS.

BOO-BOO: MARS IS THE PLANET OF £$%&IN' WAR, AND THAT AIN'T ABOUT ANGER. IT'S ABOUT STRATEGY.

BOO-BOO: COLD DECISIONS, COLD JUDGMENT.

BARBARA: YEAH. THESE FLAMES AIN'T COLD, EXACTLY, BUT THEY AIN'T BURNIN' US, NEITHER.

BARBARA: GUESS IT'S LIKE THE WATER IN THAT VENUS PLACE: THIS AIN'T FIRE. IT'S WHAT FIRE STANDS FOR.

BOO-BOO: THAT'S RIGHT. AND HERE, FIRE MEANS WILL. NOT HUMAN WILL, BUT THE WILL THAT MOVES THE SUNS AND PLANETS. UNIVERSAL WILL.

BOO-BOO: UNIVERSAL FIRE.

SOPHIE: YES. THIS PLACE EVEN FEELS SORT OF GOOD. NOT SO MUCH SCARY AS EXHILARATING. POWERFUL...

BARBARA: YEAH, BUT IT AIN'T SOMEWHERE I CAN SEE MY STEVE VISITIN'. STEVE WAS SO PLACID.

BOO-BOO: YEAH, PLUS HE WAS A HALF-ASSED WIZARD, REMEMBER?

BOO-BOO: LIKE I SAY, THEY ALWAYS TAKE THIS ROUTE UP TO THE GODHEAD.

SOPHIE: WHY? ACCORDING TO THE KABALLAH, THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER ROUTES THEY COULD TAKE UP THE TREE OF LIFE.

BOO-BOO: IT'S 'CAUSE THEY'RE A BUNCH OF £$%&IN' SHOWOFFS, TREATIN'THE KABALLAH LIKE A £$%IN' TOURIST MAP.

BOO-BOO: THEY GOTTA "DO" EVERYWHERE, SEE?

BOO-BOO: £$%&, THIS IS STEEP. I OUGHTTA REMEMBER WE AIN'T ON A HUMAN SCALE ANYMORE.

BARBARA: UNNFF. I SEE WHATCHA MEAN.

BARBARA: SO, THIS ROUTE WE'RE ON. YOU SAID IT WAS SOME SORT OF LIGHTNING BOLT PATH...

BOO-BOO: YEAH. THE ENERGY OF GOD CRACKLES DOWN INTO MATERIAL EXISTENCE THROUGH THESE SPHERES, THESE NUMBERED STAGES.

BOO-BOO: HERE IN GEBURAH, IT'S PURGED OF ANY IMPURITIES. ANYTHING FLAWED. ANYTHING WEAK.

BARBARA: HELL.A-ARE THEY THE GODS OF THIS PLACE?

BOO-BOO: THEY ARE THIS PLACE. THIS PLACE IS THEM, JUST LIKE IT'S MARS AND TOBACCO SMOKE, THE COLOR RED, THE NUMBER FIVE.

BOO-BOO: GODS OF WAR AND JUSTICE. GODS OF STRENGTH, HAMMERING THE £$%&IN' IRON INTO EVERYTHING.

SOPHIE: I--I'M GLAD THEY'RE THERE. I'M GLAD THE UNIVERSE HAS GOT THEIR POWER BURNING IN IT, WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH DARKNESS.

BARBARA: YEAH. ALL THE EVIL THERE IS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE STUFF PROMETHEA'S SUPPOSED TO END. IT'S SO STRONG...

SOPHIE: PERHAPS. BUT WE'RE STRONGER.

BARBARA: YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE STRONGER THAN ANYTHING.

BOO-BOO: UHH... LADIES?

SOPHIE: BARBARA, WHEN I THINK OF ALL THE SCUMMY INJUSTICES HURTING PEOPLE, MY WRATH IS MIGHTY.

BOO-BOO: HEY, YOU'RE TALKIN' LIKE £$%&IN' WRESTLERS! IT'S JUST THIS PLACE, ITS RUSH...

SOPHIE: NO. PEOPLE ARE STARVED, POISONED AND MASSACRED!

BARBARA: OUR ANGER IS RIGHTEOUS.

BOO-BOO: NO! DON'T GET ANGRY!

SOPHIE: AND DARK... SHALL NOT PREVAIL... AGAINST MY RAGE...

BARBARA: WH-WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?

SOPHIE: I-- I DON'T KNOW.

SOPHIE: I--I'M STILL ANGRY, BUT IT'S NOT THAT SORT OF ANGRY-HORNY ANYMORE. NOW IT'S ANGRY-SCARED.

SOPHIE: WE'RE SOMEPLACE BAD.

ASMODEUS: YOU'RE IN THE WORLD OF SHELLS.

ASMODEUS: YOU'RE IN THE BLACK BARK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE.

ASMODEUS: YOU'RE WHERE I LIVE.

ASMODEUS: I AM THE DEMON REGENT CALLED ASMODEUS.

SOPHIE: WORLD OF SHELLS. OH GOD...

SOPHIE: BARBARA, WE'RE IN THE QLIPPOTH. IT'S THE ADVERSE TREE OF LIFE. IT'S LIKE SPIRITUAL ANTI-MATTER.

BARBARA: OH JESUS.S-SOPHIE, WE SAW ASMODEUS BEFORE. HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT!

ASMODEUS: I DO NOT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING.

ASMODEUS: I AM WRATHFUL FOREVER IN RED.

ASMODEUS: MY HATE IS BEETLES IN YOUR WOMB.

ASMODEUS: I WILL DEVOUR YOU.

BARBARA: EEUUGHHH!!! OH NO ! OH, THERE'S STUFF CRAWLING INSIDE ME!

BARBARA: YOU LET ME DOWN. YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT MAGIC AND YOU LED US INTO THIS, YOU IGNORANT LITTLE BITCH!

ASMODEUS (OFF PANEL): YES. SOPHIE HURT EVERYONE.

SOPHIE: I DIDN'T! I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO US?

BARBARA: WH-WHAT AM I SAYING? Y-YOU ONLY CAME HERE TO HELP ME. I C-CALLED YOU A BITCH...

ASMODEUS: SOPHIE HURT EVERYONE. TRICKED GRACE. TRICKED STACIA.

SOPHIE: I...I DIDN'T TRICK THEM! THEY'RE NOT SUFFERING! YOU'RE LYING! YOU'RE LYING ABOUT ALL OF THIS!

SOPHIE: Y-YOU'RE NOT EVEN ASMODEUS. HE HAD THREE HEADS AND RODE A DRAGON...

PROMETHEA: YOU KNOW, DARLING, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HOW SILLY OF ME TO THINK I NEED A SWORD AGAINST YOU...

PROMETHEA: ...WHEN ALL I NEED IS THE INTELLIGENCE IT SYMBOLIZES.

PROMETHEA: NO. WE CAN'T. NOT UNTIL WE STOP PRETENDING THAT YOU'RE SOME FORCE OUTSIDE US, CAUSING ALL THE HARM IN THE WORLD.

PROMETHEA: NOT UNTIL WE'RE PREPARED TO OWN YOU.

VEPAR: OWN US? WHAt DOES SHE... AAAA!

PROMETHEA: OWNING YOU, DARLING. IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DISOWNING YOU, PRETENDING YOU'RE NOT PART OF US.

PROMETHEA: YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, VEPAR. YOU CAUSE TURBULENCE. YOU KILL MEN, CRUELLY.

PROMETHEA: I'VE DONE THAT. I ACCEPT YOU, VEPAR. I OWN YOU.

VEPAR: NO! DON't...

PROMETHEA: URRRM.

ASMODEUS: EAT YOU, ASMODAY WILL EAT YOU NOW...

SOPHIE: WHERE'S GRACE? SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY DEVILS, THEN THE PICTURE VANISHED. SHE'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE? GRACE...STACIA... THEY'RE BOTH DEAD.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, IT'S THIS THING! IT'S CHEWING ON OUR EMOTIONS! GOD, I HATE IT! I HATE IT!

BARBARA: I'M GOING TO KILL IT! I'M GOING TO KILL THIS £$%&ING THING ONCE AND FOR ALL!

SOPHIE: N-NO...

SOPHIE: NO, BARBARA. Y-YOU WERE RIGHT. IT EATS EMOTION, A-AND I THINK IT LIKES ANGER BEST.

BARBARA: SOPHIE, IT'S SCUM! DEMONS, THEY'RE £$%&ING SCUM, THEY'RE FILTH, THEY...

SOPHIE: NO, BARBARA. NO HATE. NO FEAR. NO ANGER. IT JUST CHEWS THAT STUFF UP AND FEEDS IT BACK TO US.

SOPHIE: LORD ASMODEUS, WE'VE TRESPASSED HERE, AND TREATED YOU WITHOUT RESPECT.

SOPHIE: FORGIVE US.

ASMODEUS: THAT'S BETTER.

ASMODEUS: IN FACT, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

BARBARA: S-SOPHIE? H-HE'S...

ASMODEUS: ...HUMAN? BUT OF COURSE.

ASMODEUS: APPROACH US WITH FEAR, WITH HATRED AND REVULSION, AND WE WILL BE FEARSOME, HATEFUL AND VILE.

SOPHIE: Y-YOU REFLECT US SOMEHOW, DON'T YOU?

ASMODEUS: APPROACH US HUMANELY AND WITH RESPECT, AND WE WILL BE HUMAN AND RESPECTABLE.

ASMODEUS: VERY MUCH SO. WE'RE MUCH CLOSER TO YOU THAN THE GODS, FOR EXAMPLE.

ASMODEUS: THE MOTIVES OF GODS ARE UNFATHOMABLE, WHEREAS WE DEMONS RAGE AND CHEAT AND BELLOW.

ASMODEUS: WE'RE LIKE YOU.

SOPHIE: WHAT ABOUT LOVE? CAN YOU LOVE?

ASMODEUS: YES. IN OUR WAY.

ASMODEUS: IN ANCIENT PERSIA I LOVED A HUMAN PRINCESS. AFRAID OF ME, HOWEVER, SHE MARRIED A MORTAL.

ASMODEUS: I KILLED HIM ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT. AND THE NEXT HUSBAND. AND THE NEXT. SEVEN, IN ALL.

ASMODEUS: SEVEN TOMBS FOR SEVEN GROOMS.

ASMODEUS: THE STORY IS IN THE BIBLICAL APOCRYPHA, IN THE BOOK OF TOBIT.

ASMODEUS: I IMAGINE IT'S HOW I CAME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANGER AND WRATH.

SOPHIE: A-ANGER IS GRACE'S WEAKNESS, THE WOMAN YOU SHOWED US.

SOPHIE: I-IS SHE OKAY?

ASMODEUS: OH YES.

ASMODEUS: SHE FINALLY LEARNED TO SWALLOW HER ANGER...

ASMODEUS: ...ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

?: MY LEGS. THEY TURNED ME INTO A SLUG. THEY...

KAREN: EVERYBODY'S IN SHOCK. AND THE, UH, THE NUMBER TWO, ON THE WALL? I THINK THOSE ARE DEMON SIGNATURES.

LUCILLE: YEAH. THIS IS SOME FANCY @#*&.

LUCILLE: KAREN, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS AHEAD. LET'S CHECK IT OUT...

HEADING: X

MAYOR: Are they GONNED? Are the nasty monsters all gonned AWAY?

MAYOR: BEDAD, AnD WEREn'T ThEY SOME DIVILS nOW?

KAREN: LOOK! THERE SHE IS! SHE'S GETTING AWAY!

LUCILLE: OKAY, LADY, FREEZE! AGENTS BALL AND BREUGHEL, FBI!

LUCILLE: WE WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS...

LUCILLE: ...ABOUT DENNIS DRUCKER...

ON SIGN: -K-

KAREN: DAMN.

ASMODEUS: ...AND SO YOU SEE, ONCE SHE'D EATEN ALL THE DEMONS, INCLUDING ME, SHE JUST FLEW AWAY.

SOPHIE: GOOD. I'M GLAD GRACE AND STACIA ARE OKAY.

BARBARA: B-BUT...HOW CAN ASMODEUS BE THERE AND HERE AT ONCE?

BARBARA: AND WHERE'S HERE, ANYWAY? WHAT'S A QLIPPOTH?

ASMODEUS: LIKE GODS OR ANGELS...OR HUMANS, FOR THAT MATTER... DEMONS HAVE MANY IDENTITIES. WE ARE LEGION.

ASMODEUS: THE QLIPPOTHS ARE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD AS HELLS, ALTHOUGH THE WORD MEANS HUSKS, OR SHELLS.

ASMODEUS: IT'S WHAT REMAINS ONCE THE SACRED ENERGY IN THINGS HAS DEPARTED.

ASMODEUS: THE SACRED ENERGY IS MEANING. WHEN THE MEANING IN A THING MOVES ON, THAT THING BECOMES A HUSK.

ASMODEUS: BEAUTY, WITHOUT MEANING BECOMES HOLLOW PRIDE. STERN JUDGMENT, WITHOUT THE JUDGMENT, BECOMES EMPTY RAGE.

ASMODEUS: BECOMES A HUSK. A SHELL. A QLIPPOTH.

ASMODEUS: BECOMES ME.

SOPHIE: IF QLIPPOTHS ARE HUSKS LEFT WHEN GOOD DEPARTS, DOES THAT MEAN EVIL ISN'T A REAL THING, IN ITSELF?

SOPHIE: IT'S JUST AN ABSENCE OF GOOD, LIKE DARK'S AN ABSENCE OF LIGHT?

ASMODEUS (OFF PANEL): NATURALLY. AM I EVIL? IN ANTIQUE PERSIA, DID I NOT LOVE?

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): KILLING SEVEN OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S FIANCÉS AND SENDING HER NUTS ISN'T CALLED LOVE.

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): IT'S CALLED STALKING.

BOO-BOO (OFF PANEL): THEY FINALLY DROVE HIM INTO EGYPT BY BURNING INCENSE AND FISH LIVERS. HE TELL YA THAT?

ASMODEUS: HMMPH. PERHAPS I WANTED TO VISIT EGYPT, DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT? OR DON'T HOLY GUARDIAN ANGELS EVER TAKE HOLIDAYS?

BARBARA: BOO-BOO? YOU FOUND US?

BOO-BOO: I AM YOU, YOU £$%&IN' DOPE! I SEE YOU WORKED OUT HOW TO HANDLE MY LEARNED £$%&IN' FRIEND OVER THERE.

SOPHIE: YOUR FRIEND?

ASMODEUS: "FRIEND" IS PERHAPS A LITTLE STRONG...

BOO-BOO: HEY, £$%& YOU, BRIMSTONE BOY!WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME THING, AIN'T WE?

BOO-BOO: IT'S JUST I'M PARTYIN' IN THE PENTHOUSE WHILE YOU MOLEST FIRST-GRADERS IN THE BOILER ROOM.

BOO-BOO: YOU JUST GOT STUCK WITH THE DIRTIEST JOB IS ALL. YOU AIN'T SO BAD.

ASMODEUS: LOOK, IF WE'RE SUCH GOOD PALS, WHY DON'T WE JUST £$%&?

SOPHIE: Y-YOU'RE NOT KIDDING, ARE YOU? YOU REALLY LIKE HIM.

BOO-BOO: HEY, LEMME TELLYA SOMETHIN': ALL OF US, WE CAN ONLY SEE IN OTHERS WHAT WE RECOGNIZE FROM OURSELVES, OKAY?

BOO-BOO: NOW, I'M AN ANGEL. WE LOOK AT LIFE, AN' THAT'S ALL WE SEE, MAN.

BOO-BOO: ANGELS.

SOPHIE: SO YOU THINK THE BEST OF EVERYBODY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN YOU...

BARBARA: YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT DEMONS? WHAT DO THEY THINK WHEN THEY LOOK AT LIFE?

ASMODEUS: WE THINK THE ANGELS ARE RUNNING A SCAM. THAT'S WHAT WE'D BE DOING.

ASMODEUS: FAREWELL, WOMEN. HAVE A SAFE RETURN TO THE FIFTH SPHERE.

ASMODEUS: SHOW YOUR FACES HERE AGAIN AND I'LL RAPE YOU WITH BURNING MARLINSPIKES.

BOO-BOO: HEHEH. DEMONS, MAN.

BOO-BOO: YA GOTTA LOVE 'EM.

SOPHIE: GEBURAH. WE'RE BACK.

SOPHIE: LOOK, WE'RE SORRY ABOUT GETTING LOST LIKE THAT.

BOO-BOO: FORGET IT. YOU WERE TESTED, AND YOU CAME THROUGH. YOU WEREN'T £$%&IN' DESTROYED OR NOTHIN'.

BOO-BOO: THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS PLACE. THAT'S WHAT LIFE ON MARS IS ALL ABOUT.

BOO-BOO: IT AIN'T THAT THE UNIVERSE IS CRUEL OR UNKIND. IT'S JUST THAT IT CAN'T AFFORD TO GET SENTIMENTAL.

BOO-BOO: THAT'S WHY THE JUDGMENT HAS TO BE STERN. THE ENERGIES AT WORK IN EVERYTHIN', THEY GOTTA BE PURE. NOTHIN' UNWORTHY. NO CRAP.

BOO-BOO: GEBURAH'S WHERE THE WORLD GETS THE @#*& BEATEN OUT OF IT.

BARBARA: I-IS IT OKAY TO SAY THAT IT SORT OF GETS ME HOT?

BARBARA: I--I MEAN, I AIN'T INTO VIOLENT SEX OR ANYTHIN', BUT ALL THESE RAGING VOLCANOES, THIS SOLDIER-BOY ATMOSPHERE...

BARBARA: ...IT REALLY DOES IT FOR ME, Y'KNOW?

BOO-BOO: HA HA! YEAH. TELLYA, YOU GUYS HADN'T BEEN AROUND, I'D'A JUMPED ON £$%&IN' ASMODAY'S LAP, DONE HIM THERE AND THEN, MAN!

SOPHIE: BOO-BOO!

BOO-BOO: WHAT?

BOO-BOO: HE'D BE PRETTY £$%&IN' CUTE HE DID SOMETHIN' ABOUT THAT £$%&IN' BREATH, MAN.

BOO-BOO: BESIDES, THIS PLACE IS ABOUT SEX AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. SEE, STRENGTH, WE DON'T ONLY USE IT FOR FIGHTIN', KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

BOO-BOO: GEBURAH'S ANY DECISIVE ACTIVITY. THAT'S WHY TOBACCO IS IT'S PERFUME, 'CAUSE IT'S A STIMULANT, SEE?

ON SIGN: ROUTE 19

BARBARA: YES, I GUESS. IT'S JUST I NEVER REALLY CONNECTED JUDGMENT WITH FEELIN' HORNY BEFORE.

BOO-BOO: YEAH, WELL, MAYBE IF YOU HAD, YOU'D'A BEEN MORE PICKY WHO YOU LAID.

BOO-BOO: AS FOR CONNECTIN' STRENGTH WITH LUST, IT'S ONLY NATURAL, MAN.

BOO-BOO: TAKE THIS TAROT PATH WE'RE WALKIN' ON, FOR EXAMPLE...

BOO-BOO: ...IT'S BOTH OF 'EM.

SOPHIE: I UNDERSTAND. THIS PATH'S TAROT NAME WAS STRENGTH, THEN CROWLEY CHANGED IT TO LUST.

BARBARA: THAT BROAD RIDIN' THE LION LOOKS PRETTY WILD. WHAT'S SHE SUPPOSED TO SYMBOLIZE?

BARBARA: OR IS SHE JUST ADVERTISIN' ROLLIN' ROCK OR SOMETHIN'?

BOO-BOO: HEH. NAH, SHE'S GOT TWO MEANINGS...

BOO-BOO: SEE, THIS PATH CONNECTS SPHERE FIVE, STRENGTH, WITH SPHERE FOUR, MERCY.

BOO-BOO: CONSIDERED ONE WAY, SHE'S SOME DRUNK 'HO RIDIN' A £$%&IN' LION. IT'S STRENGTH, BUT IT'S AMORAL.

BOO-BOO: CONSIDERED ANOTHER, THAT CUP MEANS COMPASSION. SHE'S TEMPERING JUDGMENT WITH MERCY.

BOO-BOO: 'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED, GIRLFRIENDS...

BOO-BOO: STRAIGHT TO MERCY.

BOO-BOO: STRAIGHT INTO THE BLUE.
