m50 | canon t4i, t5i, t6i | Panasonic gh5

## Camera Q&A

B: What camera can I buy that lasts long and is simple enough to use as first camera? Budget 300-1000 american dollars
perhaps you can make a blog post if this may be useful to others? I mean, maybe a vlog, but with links of information... Just shooting ideas.  
E: I’d recommend the m50 for your goals.  It is light and affordable and has a flip screen.  Or you can find a used canon t4i, t5i, t6i etc those work too.   Keep in mind that any camera will struggle in low light settings    And most stop recording for clips longer than thirty min.  
So you might want to get a small light and microphone as well.  
You can get all that for under 1000

B: With this budget is there no chance to get a two hour camera? If possible at some point I may travel North to US or Canada and buy a camera. I'll check the Spanish video. Thanks!!  
E: There is but I’m not educated on which cameras do it at a low budget!  I have a Panasonic gh5 and it can record infinitely.  But it’s more expensive and not new user friendly so I didn’t recommend!
