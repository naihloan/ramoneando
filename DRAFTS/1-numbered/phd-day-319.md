This is a very good film as shown from the complete and pure perspective of Alex the participant.  As far as I know this is the first time that a runner has chronicled their entire journey in such a meaningful, clear, and beautiful manner.  On the surface it is of course the challenge of a runner testing themselves with one of the greatest challenges in multi day sport.  Alex however went much further than the physical distance.  It was a spiritual quest for his own personal discovery and fulfillment.  This short film allows all of us to participate and hopefully take further steps on our own personal journeysï»¿
