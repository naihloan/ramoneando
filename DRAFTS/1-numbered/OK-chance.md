Hi Kai and others

Definitely interested in getting involved in any aspect of planning/production /exhibition for RUN! RUN! RUN! 2020
There may be some timely possibiities of putting something together for some kind of funding bid and they are holding bid-writing workshops regularly at our place.

I am also planning my own event / artwork for around that time, Running the Thames from Source to Sea as a live running performance artwork/event. I am hoping to link it to the Estuary Festival hosted by METAL arts and culture and there may also be an opportunity for me to get some support from Tilbury Dock Arts & Culture programme.
These could perhaps be interestig connections

It would be good to meet for a chat or get a working group together perhaps.

Let me know what your thoughts are

p.s Further to my email below, I also hope to of course realise the circumnavigation of the Périphérique (in a day?), following my proposal/ test run to the edge in November as part of the RUN! RUN! RUN! Biennale 2018 #r3fest

Best
