Dear all,
First of all, best wishes for 2019!
One of my good intentions for the new year is to introduce myself to the list (I've been on it for a while, but hadn't yet found the time to do so).
I'm a sociocultural anthropologist based at the University of Leuven, Belgium, where I founded the Cultural Mobilities Research (CuMoRe) cluster. I've a long-term interest in human mobilities, broadly defined. I started off by looking at broad border-crossing "movements" (e.g. migration and tourism), but have become more and more interested in the embodied and emplaced aspects of locomotion. 
My latest research project, in collaboration with movement scientist (and triathlete) Jeroen Scheerder, looks at endurance running and walking. We're not only interested in the practitioner point of view but also the organizers of endurance events and all the stakeholders in between these two parties.
I've been a recreational runner (never competitive) since my teens. I love running in natural environments and spend as much of my free time as possible exploring new trails. Whenever I travel (quite a bit given the topic of my research), I take my running shoes along!

Kind regards,
