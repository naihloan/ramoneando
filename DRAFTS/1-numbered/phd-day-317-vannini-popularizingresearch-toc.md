\
As national educational policies, economic imperatives, and
institutional pressures to “outreach” and expand the relevance of
research grow, more and more scholars and professional practitioners
find themselves increasingly unprepared to reach out to wider audiences.
Even though many researchers are willing to bridge the lexical mote
surrounding the ivory tower, they find themselves unable to write for
larger publics or are discouraged by the rapid technical development and
widening choice in new media, new genres of representation, new ways of
involving communities, and new processes for reaching different
audiences.

\
This book is meant to offer both academic and professional researchers
as well as advanced students a broad survey of ways to popularize
research. As an edited interdisciplinary handbook accompanied by a
website featuring samples of popularized research, it aims to *tell* its
readers about new genres, new media, new strategies, and new imperatives
for popularizing research, and to *show* how these new processes work in
the end, what they sound like, and what they look like.

\
Contributors were asked to provide the editor with two products: a
“show,” and a “tell.” The “show” is a sample of the contributor’s own
popularized research. All of the “shows” are available on this website.
The “tell” component is a reflection piece on how the “show” was
produced and distributed. Each “tell” is a 5000 word chapter in the
book.

\
*Popularizing Research *was created to work as a complement to research
methods courses. It is priced at US\$ 38.95 and it is 232 pages long. It
can be purchased online at
[www.peterlang.com](http://www.peterlang.com/) or through major online
retailers, such as
