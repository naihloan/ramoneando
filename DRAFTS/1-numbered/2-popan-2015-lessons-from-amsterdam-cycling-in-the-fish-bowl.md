Lessons from Amsterdam: Cycling in the fish bowl

#### Amsterdam has just hosted the first summer school dedicated to ‘Planning the Cycling City’. Cosmin Popan was one of the 30 students from 16 countries that enrolled in the three week programme. The ambition of the programme was to  each of them with the right skills to transform their own cities into 'little Hollands.  Cosmin tells us about his experience below.... 

'[You have to go out of the fish bowl to understand a fish
bowl]{lang="ro-RO"}', says [[[[[Marco te
Brömmelstroet]{lang="en-GB"}](https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor){.western}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"}
in the introductory session of the programme, [[[[[Planning the Cycling
City]{lang="en-GB"}](http://gsss.uva.nl/summer-winter/summer/content/planning-the-cycling-city/planning-the-cycling-city.html){.western}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"}.
This metaphor, to which the professor in urban policy at University of
Amsterdam and one of the organisers of the summer school would make
reference again and again during the three weeks, does a good job to
describe why the time was right for this idea to come to life. Amsterdam
and Netherlands are said to represent state-of-the-art examples for
aspiring cycling cities and nations, yet most Dutch fail to realise just
how essential it is that they start sharing their precious know-how
across the borders.

 
Pushed to think outside this ‘fish bowl’ by Meredith Glaser, an American
who is the Amsterdam-based officer for Denmark’s
[[[[[Copenhagenize]{lang="en-GB"}](http://www.copenhagenize.com/){.western}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"}
cycle-infrastructure consultancy, Marco came to realise just how big
'the moral obligation' for the Netherlands to share their cycling
expertise with the rest of the world is. 'When Meredith approached me I
thought it's a good way to fill in the first steps of putting cycling in
the academic agenda and teaching', tells Marco.

 
As soon as they worked out the practicalities of setting up the Cycling
Summer, the next challenge was not only to select 30 students amongst
the 45 candidates, but also, as Meredith admits, to choose the topics of
discussion for each of the 13 lectures: 'Each of these could be a three
weeks summer session in itself! Just that makes it difficult to squeeze
in two lectures and discussion into a two and a half hour time frame.
It's really tough'. The domains ranged from historical, social and
political context, to land use, crossings and public space, data and
visualization, wayfinding, multimodality, marketing and bikenomics.
These keynotes were punctuated with field trips to various sites in
Amsterdam and other cities in Netherlands and abroad, as students were
assigned to build up not only some practical skills, but also to develop
their own critique of the shortcomings they come across in the 'Cycling
Paradise'.
 
The general impression is that cycling levels have always been high, if
not constantly booming, in the Netherlands and that this is due merely
to the flatness of the country. Contrary to these lazy explanations, the
historian [[[[[Ruth
Oldenziel]{lang="ro-RO"}](https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences/the-department/staff/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/20031044/){.western}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"} says
that there are [multiple ]{lang="ro-RO"}reasons [for the current levels
of cycling: ]{lang="ro-RO"}'[The role of the market and civil society
]{lang="ro-RO"}as well as[ their tight connection ]{lang="ro-RO"}is
under estimated[. The local cycling union in the Netherlands,
]{lang="ro-RO"}for example,[ moved towards the car ]{lang="ro-RO"}when
this technology became mainstream[, but ]{lang="ro-RO"}it [also
incorporated cycling ]{lang="ro-RO"}and financed separate bicycle
paths[. ]{lang="ro-RO"}This didn't happen in other countries. Equally
important was [the role of class. ]{lang="ro-RO"}W[hereas cycling was
regarded as a lower class thing in most countries starting in the 1920s
and 1930s, it was seen as class neutral in Netherlands]{lang="ro-RO"}'.
[Amsterdam]{lang="ro-RO"}'s cycling is seen by Oldenziel[ as
]{lang="ro-RO"}'[an accident of history, not the work of policy makers,
but rather the result of activism and late automobility]{lang="ro-RO"}'.

 

###### Watch a documentary about the protests in Nieuwmarkt, Amsterdam, in the spring of 1975. They are considered a turning point for Dutch cycling.

A similar take is shared by the sociologist [[[[[Giselinde
]{lang="en-GB"}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"}[[[[Kuipers]{lang="ro-RO"}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"}](http://www.giselinde.nl/){.western}[,
]{lang="ro-RO"}who shows that physical infrastructure alone can't be
held responsible for the high levels of cycling in the Netherlands. She
makes the case for the bicycle as a [national symbol and pride
]{lang="ro-RO"}for the Dutch: 'Throughout the history there has been
l[ittle distance between classes and social status
gr]{lang="ro-RO"}[oups ]{lang="ro-RO"}here. Also, the Calvinism
reinforced a rather egalitarian society, with l[ittle ostentatious
demonstration of power ]{lang="ro-RO"}as well as s[ober “bourgeois”
lifestyle promoted top-down. ]{lang="ro-RO"}All these contribute to the
high levels of cycling we have today'.

 
These less visible infrastructures seem to have had a higher impact than
often acknowledged on the current state of cycling which, surprisingly
for many, hasn't increased from 25% modal share nationwide in the last
four decades. What we experience today is more of a self-sustained yet
fragile cycling bonanza hardly encouraged through a dedicated national
plan for this mode of transportation. 'Cycling is self-organising,
informal, a social activity and a bit anarchistic', admits the architect
[[[[[Stefan
Bendiks]{lang="en-GB"}](http://www.artgineering.nl/){.western}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}]{lang="zxx"}]{style="color: #000080;"},
who observes that a car minded thinking is still prevalent when
designing for cyclists in the Netherlands. He's amongst the few
practitioners advocating for Amsterdam to be more of a 'living lab' for
cycling that doesn't work with common standards, as he dismisses current
pragmatic solutions such as [left turn lanes at
intersections](https://bicycledutch.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/amsterdam-zuid-04.jpg),
[push-button bicycle
stoplights](http://www.fietsberaad.nl/?section=Voorbeeldenbank&lang=en&ontwerpvoorbeeldPage=Verkeerslichten&mode=detail&repository=Various+waiting-time+predictors)
or
[greenwaves](http://www.fietsberaad.nl/index.cfm?lang=en&section=Voorbeeldenbank&mode=detail&repository=Green+wave+for+cyclists).
'The more and more complex and technical solutions for cycling aren't
very smart', contends Bendiks.

This deeper understanding of cycling complexities will be taken away,
not only by the 30 foreign students who came to Amsterdam this summer,
but they will also help Marco and Meredith think how to take their
vision to the next level. Marco te Brömmelstroet has unveiled his future
aspirations: 'All this academic knowledge deserves a master programme of
two years itself. You come to the University of Amsterdam and you learn
research skills and you get a multi-disciplinary Master where you learn
to do sociology studies, engineering studies in Delft, historical
analysis, transition studies, maybe cost-benefit analysis. So we all
have our strengths'.
