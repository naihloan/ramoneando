## The Not Old - Better Show ✅ | Ultra Runner, Mark Cliggett, Pt. 1, Interview | 1 year ago

Calm paced interview, no big laughs, but interesting view on the difference of marathon and ultra. Latter is about doing split times, and not much more happens according to the interviewee. The former is more about anything can happen, and great places and views, community too. Average ultra is held with some 70 runners. Mark also has an important item in his preparation, which is a checklist, which avoids mistakes on the planning part, since later on you know that more unexpected things can happen. And he adds that ultra runners are ordinary people that simply resist pain a little more than average. 

###### Ultra Runner, Mark Cliggett, Pt. 1, Interview Fitness Friday, Interview Series Part 1, of 2. In this, first of 2 parts interview, we sit down with Mark Cliggett as he talks about what UltraRunning is, and isn’t. For one thing, in the sport of Ultra Running, cutting corners doesn’t produce results, and while “results,” per se, are not always the goal, anything less than full commitment and devotion, really, to this sport, can lead to injury and, well, worse.  This is no exaggeration.  And, Mark Cliggett will tell us all about his training regimen, the rigor, why he competes, what we in The Not Old Better audience can do to sort through some of the decisions to be made before taking on something like this sport, including volunteering and where to do it.  Mark’s excellent blog, pointlenana.wordpress.com which we’ll link to from The Not Old Better post is a very detailed “journal” of events,  Mark’s thoughts and planning, including some beautiful video and photography, which, courtesy of photographer, Scott Rokis, we’ll also add to the site. Join me, live via SKYPE, in welcoming to The Not Old Better Show, Mark Cliggett. Enjoy.
