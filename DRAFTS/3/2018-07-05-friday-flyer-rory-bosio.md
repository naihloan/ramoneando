Rory Bosio, fuelled by oatmeal, berries, avocado and eggs. All mixed
together.

**What are you up to at the moment?**\
I was over in the Dolomites for the The North Face Lavaredo Ultra Trail,
part of the Ultra Trail World Tour. It's a 119km trail race with more
than 6000m of ascents. It is probably the most spectacularly beautiful
place I've ever run. The mountains are dramatic, with unbelievable rock
formations. The trail is fairly runnable for the first half but the
second half of the race, especially the last 40km, is very technical,
and has rocky, steep climbs and descents. I placed 1st female, 18th
overall and set a new course record. It was the icing on top of an
already delicious cake. My experience in Italy reinvigorated my running.
Before going over to Italy I was feeling a little ho-hum about racing
and running in general. But after spending a few days out on the trails
for six to eight hours a day I'm more excited than ever!

**Where is your favourite place to run?**\
Wherever my two feet can take me. I prefer areas with mountains, single
track, views, no people, wildflowers, a gentle breeze. Mountain ranges
like the Alps, Dolomites, Sierra Nevadas, San Juans – they all satisfy
these requirements. Running is all about the scenery for me. I refuse to
run indoors or on a treadmill because, mentally, I find it exhausting. I
do not have the fortitude to run just for the sake of running. I like to
use running as a way to escape from everyday life or to see a new place.
[Fitness](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness){.u-underline}
is a great by-product. I choose races based on location rather than
competition. If I'm running somewhere that inspires me, or I find
beautiful, I usually have a better race anyway.

**Do you remember your first-ever race? How old were you, and how did
you fare?**\
Yes. It was the Presidential Fitness Challenge, Grade 3 (8yrs old), 1
mile. It was brutally difficult. Turned me off running for years! I
remember my best friend beating me and thinking she was so cool because
she could run so fast. I think I puked at the end. Not my distance.

**When someone asks you for a training tip, what do you tell them?**\
Take advice but make sure to listen to your body. There is no
one-size-fits all for ultra marathon training. When I first started
running longer distances I was too concerned by what other people were
doing and would feel anxious or like I wasn't training hard enough when
I compared my workouts to other runners. Do what feels right to you. I
don't keep a training log or follow a plan. I train based on my
intuition and what my body needs. Sometimes this means doing structured
interval workouts. More often it means putting my pack on and exploring
the mountains all day at a leisurely pace. This laissez-faire approach
doesn't work for everyone, sometimes it doesn't work for me, but it's an
unstressful way to train … which I like.

**Do you like a running gadget?**\
No! I prefer to keep it as simple as possible. I don't even wear a
watch. The only gear I need is my pack, a hat, sunglasses & shoes. Wait,
are you asking do I like gadgets that run? The answer would still be no.
Imagine how hard it would be to find your phone if it could just get up
and run away.

**Do you ever run to music?**\
Yes, on occasion. I also listen to podcasts if I'm on a long solo run.
My favorite podcast is actually British. It's called [Answer Me
This](http://answermethis.wordpress.com/){.u-underline}. A tad absurdist
yet informative. I like upbeat music when I'm doing speed workouts or
any run with lots of flat sections – since it helps keep the leg tempo
up.

**What's your post-race indulgence?**\
Anything salty, fatty or sweet that I can shove in my mouth usually hits
the spot. A steak and a glass of red wine usually sounds great, followed
by dessert. Getting hungry just thinking about it!

**What's the worst thing about running?**\
Tapering. That's why I don't race more often. I don't like to taper. It
feels like wasted time. If I was a more sophisticated person I could use
the non-running time to read Proust or brush up on my Latin, but instead
I cyberstalk cute boys and daydream. Not very productive.

**And what's the best thing?**\
For me it's the flow sensation that comes usually after a few hours of
running. Everything clicks in to place and the motion of running feels
effortless. This doesn't always happen but when it does it's fantastic.

**What's the furthest you've ever run?**\
166km/106 miles.

**What do you eat on the morning of a long run or hard session?**\
Funny you should ask. Lately, I've been experimenting with breakfast. My
old standby used to be a bowl of oatmeal, berries and almonds. I looked
at my diet and realised I needed more greens. I eat enough veggies for
lunch and dinner but my breakfast was lacking. So, lately this has been
my go-to: steel cut oats (partially cooked the night before so it only
takes 10 minutes in the morning), plus blueberries, avocado, one or two
eggs and a giant handful of arugala or kale. It all goes into one pot.
Sounds odd to put greens in with oatmeal but I'm odd so there you go.
Power brekky.

**Have you ever run barefoot?**\
Yes, but not habitually. I think it feels quite nice to run barefoot on
a football pitch or other grassy area or the beach but not for a really
long period of time. I like shoes.

**What's your greatest running achievement?**\
I won my grade 8 cross country championships. Probably the happiest I've
ever been for placing first. Everything else has paled in comparison to
the elation I felt then. Teenage emotions are just so powerful!

**Would you rather watch Mo Farah or Usain Bolt – or is there someone
else who would trump them both?**\
They are both great runners with fantastic running form but a few others
would top my list: Kilian Jornet on a steep, technical descent is magic
to watch. Anton Krupicka on any climb. I try to emulate his running
style. So smooth and effortless. Then Shalane Flanagan, the US marathon
runner; she has amazing form. I drool just looking at her. Or Anna
Frost, Emelie Forsberg, Lizzy Hawker or Ellie Greenwood – all female
ultra runners who have their own style and are wicked fast. Plus any
runner in the paralympics: I tear up with emotion; very inspiring.

**Who is the greatest ever runner?**\
The person who gets the most joy out of it.
