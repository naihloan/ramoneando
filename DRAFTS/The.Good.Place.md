# The Good Place 

## Season 01 Episode 01

- No judgment. I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws. So how can we be sure this is my fault?
- You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around. You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere.

- Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me.
- Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here.

> _Well, then this system sucks. What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity? Come on. I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay. I was a medium person. I should get to spend eternity in a medium place! Like Cincinnati. Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati._
- Look, apparently it doesn't work that way. I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do.

- Unless... there is something we can do. Unless you could teach me.
- Teach you what?

- How to be good. That was your job, right?
- A professor of ethics?

- No one knew I was a problem when I arrived. Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
- [groans]

- You know I'm trying to say "ash-hole" and not "ash-hole," right?
- I got that, yes.

- Okay, give me a chance. Let me earn my place here. Let me be your **ethical guinea pig**.

- Morning, teach!
- Morning.

- What's this about?
- Well, here's what I realized. It's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do. The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate.

- I'm basically a **Utilitarian nightmare**.
- [laughs]

- Every ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you. So every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up.
- [laughs] 

- At which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need. I know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends. Now get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.
- I... I've never actually done this before. This is a theoretical fantasy. How do you row a boat?
