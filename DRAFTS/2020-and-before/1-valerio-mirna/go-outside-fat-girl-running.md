Fat Girl Running: Mirna Valerio is Out With a New Book

“Tikki Tikki Tembo” recounts a folktale in which a boy falls into a well
and is rescued by an old man with a ladder who “step over step, step
over step” goes into the well, retrieves the boy, and then “step over
step, step over step” carries him back out.

It turns out that “step over step, step over step” also makes a great
mantra for distance runners, according to trailblazing ultramarathoner
[Mirna Valerio](http://fatgirlrunning-fatrunner.blogspot.com/).

“It gets me through a lot,” Valerio says. “I don’t necessarily think of
that folktale when I’m saying it, but it helps. One foot in front of the
other. Step over step.”

The mantra accounts for Valerio’s relentless pace on runs and in life.
She’s not the fastest, as she’s the first to admit, but the refusal to
give up has powered her rise as an athlete, a social media phenomenon,
and as of this fall, the author of a much-anticipated memoir.

Valerio is a teacher at north Georgia high school. A decade ago, a
medical scare inspired her to start running. She signed up for a bunch
of races, and in 2012, she ran her first trail marathon. Since then,
she’s gone on to run in a series of increasingly longer races,
documenting her experiences as “an active larger girl in a thinner
world” on her blog, Fat Girl Running.

Media outlets started paying attention, and over the last few years
Valerio’s profile has grown to the point that, although she shrugs off
that term, she’s become something of a trail-running celebrity.

“Things have been kind of crazy, in a really really good way,” Valerio
says. “My son is over it, though. He’s 14 years old. I’m like, hey,
CNN’s going to be here, and he’s like, ‘Yeah, that’s cool.”

These days, she’s training for August’s TransRockies Run, a 6-day trek
that covers 120 miles and 20,000 feet of climbing between Buena Vista
and Beaver Creek, Colorado.

She’s picked up a few sponsors, including Skirtsports, Swiftwick, and
Merrell. As a brand ambassador for Merrell, she has also participated in
a string of Tough Mudder events in which she charged through 10 miles of
obstacles, including crawling through live electric wires.

Getting shocked three times in one race “makes you realize how awesome
electricity is and makes you wonder how it has the capacity to blow a
245 pound human being over like a dried-out, dead flower,” Valerio wrote
on her blog about the experience.

Valerio’s appeal—to both sponsors and the more than 12,000 people who
follow her on Instagram and other social media—is not surprising: she
has refused to let stereotypes about her race or body shape dissuade her
from getting out and taking to the trails, and her unwaveringly positive
attitude encourages the idea that, hey, anyone can do this with the
right frame of mind.

“This is really an extension of what I do as a teacher, which is
demonstrating and being a role model,” Valerio says. “I talk about
diversity, about implicit bias and sexism and racism. All of that is
implicit in what I do in my public life.”

Although her story speaks to anyone who’s ever felt discouraged from
running (every runner ever, really), it also speaks to a more specific
group—African Americans who have felt uncomfortable and even fearful
entering the woods, especially in a former state of the Confederacy like
Georgia, where Valerio lives.

“Historically, African Americans weren’t always welcomed, and in some
respects still aren’t welcomed, in hiking and backpacking,” Valerio
says. “When I see someone on the trail who’s black or Latino, I’m like,
‘Hey! How are you? Good to see you!’ We both know what I mean by that
‘good to see you,’ because there’s not enough other people.

“It’s still not as welcoming a place as others—not just the woods in
themselves, but the whole outdoor culture is not necessarily welcoming.
I also get comments from black people: ‘Well, you know we don’t run in
the woods. Because the last time we ran in the woods, we got hung.’
Stuff like that, from close friends! That is so collectively in the
memory of African Americans. That’s sad and hurtful that people are
carrying this baggage with them.”

Organizations like Outdoor Afro actively work to change that
conversation and experience, and Valerio has made it a part of her
mission too. And while she didn’t consciously consider the rich heritage
of African American memoirs as she wrote her own, it nonetheless
informed the process. It’s not a coincidence, for example, that Valerio
signed with Dystel & Goderich Literary Management—the New York City firm
that represented Barack Obama on his first book.

Valerio’s memoir, *A Beautiful Work in Progress*, is set to be published
by Grand Harbor Press on October 1. With it, she hopes to take her
message to an entirely new audience.

“I wanted to frame my own narrative,” Valerio says. “My goal in writing
it is to show rather than tell people that somebody in my body can do
something like this. I wanted to show people that if you want to run in
whatever body you have, you can do it. It might be slow, it might be
painful, but you can do it. And you are entitled to exercise out in
public as you are.”
