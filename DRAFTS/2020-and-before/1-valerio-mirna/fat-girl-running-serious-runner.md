I’m a Serious Runner—Are You?
=============================

**Answer: All Runners Are Serious Runners**
-------------------------------------------

Who are you as a runner? Are you someone that aims to run at a certain
pace, or are you someone whose goal is to simply run longer? Maybe
you’re the type who runs just for fun at whatever pace your body feels
is right. Maybe you strive to PR at every race.

Are you a ‘serious’ runner? Probably.

Have you ever heard anyone mention that they are a serious runner and
had your head conjure certain images as a result? Do those images
feature a chiseled middle, prancing about on her mid-foot in a form most
conducive to fast foot turnover, winning local 5Ks and 10Ks? Are they
wearing athletic clothing that signals they are a Runner—capital R? Do
they talk excitedly about races, times, distances and vert whenever
you’re around them? (Do you even know what vert is?)

In my running life after high school and college, I was hesitant to call
myself a serious runner because I didn’t think I had that serious runner
look. I didn’t wear cute singlets and short shorts, and I definitely
didn’t prance around the crushed cinder loop in Van Cortlandt Park or
the Bridle Path in Central Park and hold conversations with equally
chipper runners. I didn’t have the right clothes, and I definitely
wasn’t wearing appropriate sneakers for running.

The funny thing? I did run nearly every day. I was pretty serious about
that. I didn’t run many miles, but it was a necessary habit, one that
allowed me to move my body up and down long city blocks, the way it was
meant to.

The summer before I went to college in 1994, I apprenticed at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and
stared longingly at the runners gliding by in Central Park during my
lunch breaks. I wanted to be one of them. They looked so cool and
athletic. I already had the running piece down—now all I had to do was
get out there and be part of the crowd. I decided to buy a pair of
sneakers with my first paycheck—a whole \$200.

I walked into a nearby shoe store one day after work and asked to see
the running shoes. A young man came over to help and asked what kind of
shoe I was looking for and for what kind of mileage.

“Oh, I don’t know, like a mile or two per day?” I said, a hint of pride
in my voice. I was a runner and I *knew* it. I just needed some good
shoes to complete the look.

“A mile or two? Hmmpph…” he half laughed and half snickered, turning on
his heels to walk to the storage room, shaking his head.

“Can you just get me my shoes please?” I asked indignantly—and a bit
sadly.

Maybe this dude was used to the svelte runners who ran more miles and
bounced up and down perkily, but I was so determined to get my feet into
some real running shoes that I was willing to let this little judgmental
jab slide.  He came back with the shoes in my size: big, size 11 green
Adidas. My first real pair of running shoes for my once-a-day, 1- to
2-mile serious runs as a serious runner.

**Are you a serious runner? Take this completely unscientific and biased test:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Do you run regularly?
-   Do you hope to achieve some life goal through running?
-   Do you enjoy running?
-   Do you look forward to the weekend because you’ll finally get to put
    some much-needed miles in?
-   Do you identify yourself as a runner even if other folks don’t?
-   Do you dream about running?
-   Do you become nostalgic for running when you drive by a runner on
    the road?
-   Does your body do the thing where you put your running clothes on
    and it starts priming itself, even if you’re not mentally feeling
    it?

If you answered “yes” to one or more of the questions above, bingo!
You’re a serious runner.  When you think of yourself as a serious
runner, all it means is that you take running seriously. Easy, right?

Even if you’re not familiar with terms like vert, PR, or VO2 max, that
doesn’t mean you’re not serious about your chosen sport. Does knowing
what those things are help in any way? Maybe—but not knowing all the
cool terms and not having all the cool gear doesn’t take away from the
fact that you are actually doing the thing: engaging your body in
forward movement, both feet momentarily suspended in the air…running.

I’ve heard people say that they *aren’t* serious runners even though
they put in significant mileage and spend more than a few hours a week
running with a variety of goals in mind. In my book, if anyone is
setting aside time each week to move their body in a runner-ly way, they
are a serious runner. Of course, it really doesn’t matter what I think,
but give yourself some credit for the running that you do.

It’s okay to be modest about what you accomplish, but it’s also okay to
celebrate what you have achieved, particularly when life throws
curveballs at you (in the form of work, illness, injury, family needs
and other things) and you manage to still get your run on. Too many
folks downplay their achievements, not wanting to seem boastful. But I
say that, if you run and it is an important part of your life or fitness
regime, be proud and share your success with others. You never know who
is watching. Your child, your relatives, your coworkers…they might be
the ones that need to witness that strength, focus and energy emanating
from you so that, maybe one day, they can try running themselves. Spread
the love, ye serious runners!

My name is Mirna Valerio, aka @TheMirnavator. I am a native of Brooklyn
and current resident of northeast Georgia. I'm a Spanish teacher,
diversity educator, cross-country coach, marathoner, ultrarunner and
blogger, writing about all things running and living life to its fullest
while being a larger gal on my blog,
[](http://fatgirlrunning-fatrunner.blogspot.com/)Fatgirlrunning. I have
a son who is 12 and a hubby who travels a lot, mostly in West Africa. I
try to live by example. We only have one body and one life. We must love
our bodies and ultimately our entire selves in order to be whole people,
in order to live our lives to the fullest. The road to self-acceptance
and self-love is a long one, and one that requires a commitment to
loving yourself (and spreading that love to others) no matter how you
perceive yourself that moment, day, or year. Get out there and be. And
run all the roads and trails.
