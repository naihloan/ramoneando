> *I didn't find it difficult when I started to run, because I was running even 100 kilometers ... You know, when the police is chasing you, and you chase the cattle.* [...] * My life here is so good. I used to take milk only with the blood. But nowadays, I eat ugali, I eat different foods, I bathe properly, and then I walk briskly, like the other people. 

> I suffered a great deal as a result of the small arms problem. I had an AK-47. I can tell you that when a young warrior gets hold of our firearm, he thinks of no other means of livelihood. 

> I am the millionth face, the millionth person to have joined the petition. I lost my friends, I lost my relatives. Even I lost my brother.

##### *You learn so much more about balancing your body. And learn also that running is not only running. Running is 99% important. But that single one percent, what is in time not too much, but it's very important as well to do it.*

Julius Arile's Mother: *I have started to lose weight, and I am getting old. I am taking care of your children.*

Julius Arile: *I was thinking maybe I'll take a rope or take a gun and shoot myself, because I bring a lot of problems.* 

Commentator on New York Marathon: *There's Arile, the former gun runner, or cattle rustler, is up front. This is why you have to have a cool head, because of the surge of adrenaline you get.*
