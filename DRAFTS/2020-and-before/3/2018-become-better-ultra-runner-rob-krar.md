Can you tell us a bit about yourself?
-------------------------------------

My name is Rob Krar. I‘m originally from Hamilton, Ontario (aka The
Hammer) but am lucky to have called Flagstaff home for over a decade
now. I know I’m biased but I think Flag is one of the greatest places in
the world to be a runner, and especially a trail and ultra runner –
amazing and never ending trails, high altitude, and truly great people.

It’s been a busy year thus far with a ton of travelling in the books and
much more to come. We just wrapped up our 3rd annual summer [Rob Krar
Ultra Camp](https://robkrar.com/camps/) and I’m off to the homeland now
to race at [The North Face Endurance Challenge
Ontario](https://www.thenorthface.com/get-outdoors/endurance-challenge/ontario-canada.html)
race at Blue Mountain resort where I grew up learning how to ski!

My day job? Slave to our two kittens. All jokes aside, these days I’m
putting the pieces together training and racing, hosting running camps,
and coaching. It’s a life I never could have imaged and I’m incredibly
thankful for it.

How and why did you get into ultra running?
-------------------------------------------

It was an unconventional start to the world of ultra running for me.
I’ve been an athlete most of my life but after surgery on both my heels
in 2010, I was sure my racing days were over. It was a series of
fortunate events – beginning with meeting my future wife in 2009 – that
the pieces of the puzzle began to come together. An introduction to ski
mountaineering the winter of 2011/2012 led to racing short distances on
the trails, which then led to racing my first ultra distance. It was an
unexpected return to running, a gift really, and I knew I needed to take
a different approach than I had in my previous running lives.

The surgery was for Haglund’s deformities. Like most stubborn athletes,
I tried to return to training too quickly and really buggered up the
recovery process to the point I was sure the surgery wasn’t successful
and I’d never run comfortably again, let alone race. I quit running
completely with no hopes of ever returning. Funny how it works though as
it was leaving running that allowed my body the time it needed to heal,
and it also coincided with meeting Christina, falling in love and
getting married — another corner piece of the athlete and person I am
today.

How do you train and become better at ultra running?
----------------------------------------------------

Consistency trumps all and I am fortunate to live in one of the greatest
places on earth to be an ultra runner. The Flagstaff trails are endless
and I can access them right out my door — it’s a rare day when I have a
need to drive to the start of a run.

I have been self-coached my entire trail and ultra career and have no
plans to change that. I have made enough mistakes and had enough
setbacks in my previous running lives to feel confident. I’m running for
the right reasons and will have a long career in the sport.

I have a very loose but focused training regimen. I aim for somewhere
between 75-100 miles per week during my training blocks but try not to
plan the specifics more than a couple days out. I know what I want to
accomplish going into each week. Example: One long run, one workout, two
strength and conditioning workouts, the other days easy run – but go
with the flow as to when during the week I will hit each specific run.

Why is ultra running important for you?
---------------------------------------

Running, especially the ultra distance, has changed the course of my
life in ways I could not have imagined a few years ago. My time, alone
on the trails, is a near daily opportunity to escape an increasingly
complicated world, to think or not think at all. It is an important part
of my sanity and happiness and almost a necessity in a way.

What are the hardest parts of ultra running?
--------------------------------------------

One of the most unique and fascinating things about racing 100 miles?
That you’re sure to go somewhere – mind and body – that you’ve rarely if
ever gone before. My longest training run for a 100 mile race is 35
miles, so how is it that I can hope to run almost three times as far
come race day? We are all capable of greatness and toeing the line of
any ultra event affords the opportunity to discover new depths, harness
unknown potential, and shatter perceived limits. It’s a beautiful thing
and not something I take for granted.

Once you get a taste of that dark place most experience during an ultra
distance race it’s hard not to want to go back and dig a little deeper
into the unknown. The experience of training for running 100 miles and
the lessons it affords can easily translate to everyday life and
contribute to a healthier, more productive and ultimately more
satisfying life.

How do you prepare for events and races?
----------------------------------------

I tailor my training blocks, usually 10-12 weeks long, to the specific
race I’m focusing on. Maintaining my strengths and improving my
weaknesses is a strategy I feel confident in. It’s always a fine line
between training to my potential while not crossing the threshold of
overtraining and injury. These days I’m willing to leave the last few
percentages of potential in training if it allows me to stand on the
starting line healthy and confident. Strength and conditioning is a big
part of my training regimen as well and is vital to hold the glue
together late in a race when the body tries its best to fall apart.

How do you eat and sleep?
-------------------------

I try to get as much rest as possible and always aim for healthy and
balanced eating. I don’t like to use specific labels for my diet, and
I’m lucky that my wife has a passion for delicious and healthy food. We
rarely eat meat – our diet could best be described as primarily grains
and greens. I can’t say there is anything I try not to eat – moderation
is key.

My calories in racing come primarily from GU Roctane Endurance Drink
Mix. At least half my calories come from this and the remaining from GU
Gels and Chews. I almost never consume solid fuel during a race,
although cold watermelon sprinkled with salt can’t be beat late in a hot
race!

I do my best to go to bed at a reasonable time and take advantage of
small blocks of time throughout the day to get horizontal and rest the
legs. I’ve enjoyed working closely with [Flora
Health](http://www.florahealth.com/home_ca.cfm) the past few years and
include their probiotics, calcium and iron supplements into my daily
regimen, not to mention their amazing line of culinary oils and teas.

How do you handle injuries and recovery?
----------------------------------------

In the past two years, I’ve formed a partnership with [Paragon
Athletics](http://www.paragonathletics.com/), who have helped me rehab
injuries and address persistent muscle weaknesses and imbalances. Coming
into the 2016 running season with possibly the best cardiovascular
fitness of my life after months of racing on my skis, I misjudged the
transition to the more impactful pounding of running. I came away with a
stress fracture and learned some lessons regarding how best to
transition between sports. It’s important for me to find activities I
can participate in for my mental health when I’m injured. Mountain
biking is often something I turn to, and this resulted in the completion
of my first 100 mile mountain bike race at
[Leadville](http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/)
in 2016

I often use an ice wrap on any particularly sore areas after hard
training efforts and races. A lacrosse ball to roll tight areas does
wonders and a rope for [Active Isolated
Stretching](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-treatment/active-isolated-stretching-exercises)
is never far away.

What are your best advice people new to ultra running?
------------------------------------------------------

Build miles gradually, participate in a few shorter trail races before
making the jump to the ultra distance. Respect recovery, especially
after races. Find purpose in your running and pay it forward – your
example will help others make positive change in their lives.
Consistency trumps all in training, strive to find a balance that allows
you to push yourself but doesn’t push you to the sidelines because of
injury. The little things count! Incorporate strength and conditioning
([prehab](http://www.paragonathletics.com/)) into your regimen.

Best advice for people who have been ultra running for years?
-------------------------------------------------------------

With so many new races over the past few years, overtraining and over
racing are becoming an increasingly common trend. Consider focusing on
just a few goal races a year and don’t be afraid to step out of your
comfort zone and challenge yourself to a race that doesn’t suit your
strengths.

Importantly, remember it’s the little things that can really count in
the long term – stretching, strength and conditioning, respecting sleep,
eating healthy, rolling, icing, etc.

How do you balance normal life with ultra running?
--------------------------------------------------

I’m very fortunate to call running, hosting camps, and coaching, a
career since 2015. I worked a graveyard shift for the previous 12 years
and once I began racing trail and ultra, it quickly became obvious it
wasn’t a sustainable lifestyle, something was going to break.

My relationships were suffering, the quality of my training was
declining, and I wasn’t able to take advantage of opportunities to
travel and race. It was a leap of faith leaving my job as a pharmacist
in 2015 but my only regret is not leaving sooner. My time is spent
training, travelling and racing of course, but planning and hosting
running camps in Flagstaff, and coaching take much of my time. It’s a
dream “job” really!

What kind of running shoes and clothes do you use?
--------------------------------------------------

My very first sponsor was [The North
Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/) and I’ve been proudly representing
them since 2013. I’m stoked to have designed a shoe with them that will
be released early 2018. It’ll be the first shoe to be included in the
[Flight
Series](https://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_17?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=north+face+flight+series&sprefix=north+face+flight%2Caps%2C215&crid=275S2YI6UX5AP&tag=mightyg-20),
which represents their lightest and most advanced running products
including my favorite Better Than Naked
[tops](https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Better-Singlet-X-Large/dp/B06XQPCBY7/)
and
[bottoms](https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Better-Naked-Split/dp/B06XQ8ZCVR/).

Shoes: The North Face Flight RKT\
Apparel: The North Face Flight Series, especially the [Better Than Naked
line](https://www.amazon.co.uk/North-Face-Better-Sleeve-T-Shirt/dp/B014S6J5U2/)\
Socks: [Smartwool PhD Ultra Light
Crew](https://www.amazon.com/Smartwool-Ultra-Light-3-Pack-White/dp/B01KGKJ53Q/)

What has been your best sport purchase below \$100?
---------------------------------------------------

[The North Face Trail
Trucker](https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Trail-Trucker-Hyper/dp/B01JND8JG6/)
has been a part of my training and racing kit for years now, beginning
at the [Western States 100M race in 2015](http://www.wser.org/2015/)
when temperatures rose well over 100 degrees during the race. It’s the
coolest and lightest trucker I’ve ever owned and blends in just as well
in town as it does on the trails.

What other favorite gear do you have?
-------------------------------------

The VaporKrar 4L & 12L Race Vests and WaistPak were released earlier
this year and are always a part of my training and racing kit. It was a
really fun project working closely with
[Nathan](https://www.nathansports.com/) from initial brainstorming and
conception, to testing prototypes, and finally to market.

What will the future bring?
---------------------------

2017 has been the year of stepping out of my comfort zone. I raced ski
mountaineering this past winter in Europe for the first time, travelled
to [Australia for the UTWT
100k](https://www.ultratrailaustralia.com.au/), and plan to compete at
the [UTWT Cape Town 100k](http://www.ultratrailcapetown.com/) in
December on a course that will be the most technical I’ve ever
attempted. In between I’ll be heading back to the [Leadville
100M](http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/run/leadvilletrail100run/) in
August, and travelling back to the homeland for [The North Face
Endurance Challenge
Ontario](https://www.thenorthface.com/en_ca/get-outdoors/endurance-challenge.html).

    Great Q&A Rob! How long did it take you to recover from the
    Haglund’s deformities surgery?

    Do you know of any tricks for recovering from plantar fasciitis and
    running with plantar fasciitis?
