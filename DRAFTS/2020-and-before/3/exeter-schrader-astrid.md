Dr Astrid Schrader
==================

Email:

Lecturer (Sociology and Philosophy)
-----------------------------------

Astrid works at the intersections of Science and Technology Studies
(STS), Human-Animal Studies and Feminist and Poststructuralist Theories.

She joined the University of Exeter in the autumn of 2013 as a [HASS
Research
Fellow](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/inspiring/keythemes/hass/)
within the theme of [Science, Technology and
Culture](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/inspiring/keythemes/hass/scitechcul/).
She previously held postdoctoral fellowships at York University,
Toronto, the University of Pittsburgh and the Pembroke Center at Brown
University and taught Science, Technology & Society Studies at Sarah
Lawrence College in Bronxville, NY. Astrid received her PhD in History
of Consciousness and Feminist Studies from the University of California,
Santa Cruz. She also holds a MSc (UC Santa Cruz) and a  Diplom (TU
Berlin) in physics.

Her work explores questions of responsibility, care and agency in
scientific knowledge production, new ontologies, the relationship
between anthropocentrism and conceptions of time, and questions of
environmental justice. Astrid has been particularly interested in
scientific research and policy decisions about so-called Harmful Algal
Blooms. Her current project examines the scientific reconfigurations of
life and death through research into programmed cell death in
unicellular marine microbes. Her work has been published in the journals
*Social Studies of Science*, *Environmental Philosophy* and
*differences.* She recently co-edited (with Sophia Roosth) a special
issue of *differences* titled [“Feminist Theory out of
Science”](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Feminist-Theory-Out-of-Science-differences/)
and currently works on a monograph.

Astrid is a member of
[Egenis](http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/sociology/research/sts/egenis/)
and the [Nambio](http://geography.exeter.ac.uk/research/groups/nambio/)
research group.
