As always, thank you all for your support!\
\
I would like to announce that I, **Miharu Shimokado**, have quit the
**Nitori** women's running team to relaunch my career as an independent
pro marathon runner. I've made this decision to go independent because
day by day I've felt more strongly that to grow as an athlete I have to
be able to express my own unique style and color, in both the on times
and the off.\
\
As an independent runner free from the threat of being crushed under the
weight of other people's image of the marathon I'm ready to become a
truly beautiful runner in every sense. As an immediate goal I'll pursue
qualifying for the MGC Race 2020 Olympic marathon trials. After that
it's making the Tokyo Olympics marathon team. I want to show that you
don't have to throw the woman part away to get stronger, that we are
strong because we are women.\
