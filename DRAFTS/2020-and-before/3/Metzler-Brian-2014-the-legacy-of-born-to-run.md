Six Years Later: The Legacy of ‘Born to Run’
============================================

By Brian Metzler | May 4, 2014

<div id="article-right" class="content" style="float: none;">

"Born to Run" has had quite a profound impact on the running world.
Illustration: Matt Collins.
*Chris McDougall’s “Born to Run” was published in May 2009.*

Journalist Christopher McDougall’s best-selling book “Born to Run: A
Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never
Seen” hit bookstore shelves on May 5, 2009. Its impact on the running
world has been considerable. Here’s a quick glance at a few of the ways
it influenced the running world and some additional developments that
have happened in the past couple of years.

**1. The Book.** McDougall’s 304-page autobiographical account of
running almost-barefoot with the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico has sold
more than a half million copies worldwide and remained on the *New York
Times* bestseller list for more than four years. Although it contains
some hyperbole, the book has earned its keep (and rave reviews) because
McDougall’s vivid story-telling, compelling character development and
in-depth reporting appeal to everyone from new runners and veteran
ultrarunners to non-runners and couch potatoes alike. For runners, it’s
on a must-read list of books that also includes, among others, “Once a
Runner” by John L. Parker, “Running With the Buffaloes” by Chris Lear,
“The Silence of the Great Distance” by Frank Murphy and “Bowerman and
The Men of Oregon” by Kenny Moore.

**2. The Legend of Caballo Blanco.** Micah True became a cult figure
known as “Caballo Blanco,” a simple man who years ago without any
fanfare befriended the impoverished Tarahumara (a.k.a. Raramuri) people
of Mexico and for 10 years organized a race to help support them. Sadly,
the 58-year-old reluctant celebrity [died during a trail run in New
Mexico](http://running.competitor.com/2012/04/news/white-horse-leads-micah-true-from-the-wilderness_50249)
in the spring of 2012 after leaving his winter home in the Copper Canyon
region of Mexico for his summer home in the foothills of Boulder, Colo.
But his free-spirited legacy, [his race](http://www.ultracb.com/) and
the worldwide attention on the Tarahumara endure.

**3. Minimalist Shoes.** The book was one of the primary catalysts for
the minimalist running shoe revolution that helped spur brands to
develop lighter, lower-to-the-ground shoes using less material. While
some would argue that “barely there” shoes led many runners to run with
insufficient cushioning and protection under their feet, there’s no
question the paradigm shift helped runners rethink about how much (and
how little) they really need in a shoe. It also spurred running shoe
manufacturers to build lighter models across all categories, you could
make the argument, eventually helped maximalist shoes explode based on
the idea that not every runner is able to run in minimalist shoes and,
instead, actually want more cushioning.

McDougall](http://running.competitor.com/2013/05/news/writing-about-running-5-questions-with-chris-mcdougall_72073)

**4. Running Form.** McDougall’s indictment of the running shoe industry
also helped further the natural running form movement, which has led to
runners realizing that it’s not only shoes that help them run better but
good mechanics and dynamic strength too. Five years later, though,
there’s no clear-cut answer about what kind of gait is best or if
runners should even try to change their form. The end result is that
more runners are running more efficiently in lighter shoes than a decade
ago, if only because shoes are lighter, built with less material and
have a lower heel-toe slope. It’s not that faster and longtime runners,
experienced coaches and some leading-edge medical professional weren’t
already practicing and preaching good form, it’s just that the message
didn’t reach the masses until after “Born to Run” came out.

</div>

**5. Other Books.** Numerous books have been written about running form,
minimalist shoes, barefoot running or the spiritual essence of running
since “Born to Run” hit bookstores, including [“Anatomy for
Runners”](http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Runners-Unlocking-Potential-Prevention/dp/1620871599)
(Jay Dicharry), [“Tread
Lightly”](http://www.amazon.com/Tread-Lightly-Footwear-Injury-Free-Running/dp/1616083743)
(Bill Katovsky and Dr. Peter Larson), [“Chi
Marathon”](http://www.amazon.com/Chi-Marathon-Breakthrough-Natural-Pain-Free/dp/145161795X/ref=bxgy_cc_b_img_b)
by Danny Dreyer, [“Eat & Run”](http://scottjurek.com/eatandrun/) (Scott
Jurek), and [“Natural
Running”](http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Running-Simple-Stronger-Healthier/dp/1934030651)
(Danny Abshire). The latest good one worth a read is [“The Cool
Impossible,”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cool-Impossible-Miles-And-Yourself/dp/0451416333)
by trainer/coach Eric Orton, who was instrumental in teaching McDougall
how to run better and become more fit. This summer, [“Hal Koerner’s
Field Guide to
Ultrarunning”](http://www.velopress.com/books/hal-koerners-field-guide-to-ultrarunning/)
will hit bookstores, while [“Unbreakable Runner: Unleash the Power of
Strength and Conditioning for a Lifetime of Running
Strong”](http://www.velopress.com/books/unbreakable-runner/) from
Cross-Fit Endurance founder Brian MacKenzie will debut in October.

Run?](http://running.competitor.com/2014/01/injury-prevention/are-we-really-born-to-run_93817)

**6. The Movie?** The movie adaptation of “Born to Run” appears to be
stuck in Hollywood. Originally, reports said actor/director Peter
Sarsgaard would be directing the movie adaptation of “Born to Run” and
Jake Gylenhaal, his brother-in-law, was expected to play a lead role. An
IMDB.com report later said the movie would be produced by the
husband-wife team of Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, who have
individually and jointly been tied to many blockbuster productions from
Steven Spielberg and Lucasfilm. However, McDougall said in 2013 a major
shake-up occurred. A new script was expected to be completed last year,
and a new director was supposed to be unveiled last summer, but the
movie is still listed as being “in development” on film industry
websites. As of this week, the new script writer is Marshall Lewy while
the producers are Michael Glassman, Deborah Jelin Newmyer and Tim
Perell, who each have a variety of lower-profile movie credits on their
resumes.

**7. Ultrarunning Growth. **Although still a small part of the running
world, ultrarunning has grown considerably since McDougall first
ventured to Mexico in 2006. According to one report published by
Ultrarunning magazine, ultra-distance race finishes in the U.S. have
gone from about 25,000 in 2007 to more than 70,000 in 2013. That pales
in comparison to marathons (about 540,000 in 2013) and half marathons
(about 2 million in 2013), but ultrarunning is growing at a much faster
rate and its stars ([Scott
Jurek](http://running.competitor.com/2013/04/inside-the-magazine/the-long-run-running-wild-in-ethiopia_70788),
[Anton
Krupicka](http://running.competitor.com/2012/12/video/video-anton-krupicka-talks-training_63214),
Kilian Jornet, [Krissy
Moehl](http://running.competitor.com/2013/02/photos/great-running-adventures-running-around-mt-kilimanjaro_65534),
[Darcy
Africa](http://running.competitor.com/2013/07/trail-running/hard-as-a-rock-5-questions-with-darcy-africa_77919)
and others) have attracted considerable attention. And because most
ultra-distance runs have smaller race fields—either by design or because
of trail permits—more races are selling out sooner. The book embellished
many ultrarunning stars and participants, including Jurek and Jenn
Shelton, as well as numerous “Mas Loco” runners who True said were
“crazy” enough to run his race.

**8. Ultra Caballo Blanco. **Speaking of his race, on March 2, 715
athletes representing 15 countries—including more than 400 Raramuri
runners—started the 12th annual Ultra Caballo Blanco, a 50-mile race and
celebration of “running free” among all cultures of running people. True
started the race to help ensure nutritional sustenance to both the
physical and cultural survival of the Raramuri people. For each loop
completed, runners receive vouchers for maize, beans, rice, flour and
non-GMO seed corn. (Non-local runners donate their portions back to the
locals.) Blankets and food are also given to Raramuri runners and their
families who come down for the race. Miguel Lara Viniegras, a local
Raramuri runner, won this year’s race in 6:39:16. The [13th annual Ultra
Caballo Blanco 50-mile race](http://www.ultracb.com/information/) and
celebration was scheduled for March 1, 2015, but was canceled due to
[violence related to drug
cartels](http://trailrunnermag.com/people/news/article/1666-double-murder-and-drug-violence-lead-to-ultramarathon-cancellation).

**9. Born to Run Ultramarathon. **Following True’s “Run Free” theme,
photographer Luis Escobar is hosting his fourth annual [Born to Run
Ultramarathon](http://www.allwedoisrun.com/?page_id=46) event on May
17-18. After gaining access to an 8,000-acre ranch in Los Olivos,
Calif., four years ago, Escobar, who was a friend of True, decided to
create an intimate social event where people could get together, camp,
sing, share some beers and run—a lot. The event has grown from 75 people
to a projected 500 participants for this year. This year
several Raramuri runners will take part in the race [thanks to online
fundraising efforts.](http://www.gofundme.com/Bring-Raramuri-to-BTR2014)

**10. Urique To Batopilas Trail. **Through the collaborative efforts of
nonprofits and international volunteers, a historic 14-mile trail from
Urique to Batopilas in Mexico’s Copper Canyons is about to re-open. The
route, part of True’s original Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon (renamed the
Ultra Maratón Caballo Blanco after his death in 2012), was plagued by
bandits and overgrown vegetation for the past several years. But with
the help of Norawas de Raramuri, (“Friends of the Running People”), the
U.S. non-profit organization True helped create in 2009, and local
resident Prospero Torres, the original trail is being revived with the
hope of creating a world-class route for international adventurers and
re-opening a vital link for locals between the canyons of Urique and
Batopilas. Norawas supports Raramuri participation in local and
international foot races by providing maize, non-GMO seed corn and cash
awards for participating Raramuri runners, men and women alike. (Watch

**11. Run Free.** But if there is anything to be remembered from all of
this notoriety, good will and/or media attention, it’s the two simple
words that continued to drive True: “Run Free!”
