## The Barkley Marathons | The Race That Eats Its Youngs [(2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400291/)

Race inspired by the James Earl Ray escape, who began serving a 99-year prison sentence by 1977. He did nearly 8 miles? 8.5 miles in 54 hours. 

Organizer says:

> *because when trail running started to become popular, and we thought it was amazing that people were running astounding times on trails. I guess the only term, it would be a ballbuster of a race.*

> *you have to pull out page 35 of that book*

> *They give us the assurance that people did the course.* 

Bizarre haunting titles (such as *Doomed*) would be on the books: "things which you would look at that book and, there's no chip timing here, there's books."

+ *The Human Zoo*, by Desmond Morris | author of *The Naked Ape*

Competitor:

> *But I think also there's this self-induced aspect of, you've struggled, you've overcome, you've gotten through, then you're confident and you both enjoy the rest of your life more, but also you feel like you can do things annd you take on challenges that you wouldn'r otherwise try, and you get to points that you wouldn't otherwise reach.*

+ This is an odyssey that's spanned over 15 years.
+ One last chance, Rob.

Organizer (Laz)

> *People have their own concepts of success and failure. A lot of them, by the time that they've been through the ordeal, really are not concerned how other people evaluate their performance. They make their own judgements about success and failure.*

+ How strong did they look?
+ Uh, John was looking pretty strong. 

For the first time in Bankley history, 3 people are out on Loop 5. 

`Brett finishs in 52 hours and 3 minutes`
`beating the speed record by 3 hours`
`becoming the first two-time finisher`

Runner:

> *I never really thought about just turning things off and taking in the beauty of it.*

Laz: "How does it feel to be the slowest man ever to finish this race?"

> *I was like, I think if you really want it bad enough Joe Schmo like me can finish. It's not going to be pretty and it's not going to be fun but it's going to be possible.* -Wouter, 12th person. 59 hours 41 minutes. 130 miles run. 60000' climbed. 0 hours of sleep. 

> *that which he acquires with hard work and toil, ... The harder you work for something, the more you enjoy that. If something is easy, how much reward is there?*

Laz: "I think that people who go through this, they're better for it. They're not made of better stuff than other people but they're better for what they've asked of themselves."

> *It's named after Barry Barkley* 

Barry: *And it's called the Barkley Marathons and I have no idea why he did it.*
