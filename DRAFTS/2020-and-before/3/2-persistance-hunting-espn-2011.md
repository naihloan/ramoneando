**AS THE RUNNER MOVES IN FOR THE KILL,** his most effective weapon --
his feet -- splash into the deep white sands of Africa's Kalahalari
Desert. The footprints that he leaves behind are like fossils dating
back to the origins of human speed. For several hours, under a
suffocating sun that has pushed temperatures toward 120 degrees, the
runner, a member of the !Xo San tribe named Karoha, has been engaged in
a persistence hunt. He's chased an animal, literally, to death.

Dating back millions of years, the persistence hunt is the most ancient
form of hunting known to man. It's also a theoretical key to both our
modern-day athletic makeup and our obsession with speed.

Gliding through the razor-sharp thornbush, the shirtless Karoha, lean
and muscular, focuses his deep-set eyes up ahead on his prey, an African
kudu antelope. Unable to rest and cool itself because of Karoha's
relentless pace, the beast is overcome by heat exhaustion. It stands
helpless, then collapses, appropriately, at the feet of the hunter.

More than 10 years after filming this scene, Craig Foster, co-director
of "The Great Dance: A Hunter's Story" and one of the few outsiders ever
to witness a persistence hunt, is still moved by the rare
anthropological glimpse back in time. "It was an extraordinary,
life-changing experience to be thrown backward like that into the
original human design," he says. "It provided this massive realization
of who we are and what our body, mind and soul had been designed to do."

To run. And do it in a way that distinguishes us from every other
species on the planet: at a moderate pace over long distances. It's not
nearly as mesmerizing, or as provocative, as conventional displays of
ambulatory velocity like, say, the explosive sprinting power of Usain
Bolt. But the truth is that our raw speed is rather unremarkable when
compared with the significance and uniqueness of our relative speed.
Persistence hunting helps prove that when it comes to human movement,
speed doesn't kill. Stamina does.

Captured on film for the first time in "The Great Dance", man's
extraordinary success as an endurance predator has helped give rise to
the endurance running evolutionary hypothesis -- a.k.a. the Running Man
theory. The basic premise is that we evolved into the species we are
today thanks to one key but long-overlooked\
attribute: the ability to run long distances. The sports implications
are both elemental and monumental, telling us that running isn't just a
whim of humans; it's why we are human.

Popularized by author Christopher McDougall in his best-selling book
"Born to Run", the Running Man theory has moved from the fringes of the\
scientific community toward the athletic mainstream, challenging nearly
everything we know about movement, sports and the human body. "It's
fascinating the way this is all connected," says Louis Liebenberg, one
of the leading experts on persistence hunting. "By exploring our past,
we are rediscovering new limits to our endurance that we were never
fully aware of."

The realization that we are all natural-born runners may play some role
in what the organization Running USA dubs marathon "mania." From 2008 to
2009, the number of participants finishing the 26.2-mile race jumped 10
percent to an\
estimated 467,000 runners, the largest percentage increase in 25 years.
Meanwhile, the number of people completing half-marathons has grown an
astronomical 131 percent since 2000, to\
1.1 million runners. (The 5K, by comparison, has increased 40 percent
during the same time frame.) What's more, the awakening of our ancient,\
running self seems to have transformed the ultramarathon -- a race up to
100 miles long or 24 hours in duration -- from a death-defying fringe
activity into one of the fastest growing segments of endurance sports.

If you believe the Running Man theory (and not everyone does),
ultrarunners aren't nuts; they're doing exactly what our bodies were
designed to do. It's the couch potatoes who\
are going against nature. Which is why the International Association of
Ultrarunners claims we could soon see a 100-mile race in the
Commonwealth Games and the Olympics. "It might sound silly, but I do
feel a connection to some ancient, Neolithic, warrior spirit in these\
races," says American Scott Jurek, a world-class ultramarathoner who won
the 100-mile Western States Endurance Run seven consecutive times. "That
connection to our primal self is drawing people to ultrarunning. I mean,
it's pretty damn cool, if you think about it, that we adapted as humans
to a point where we could run down animals."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**AND TO THINK,** our running renaissance started with a pig on a
treadmill.

In the 1990s, Dennis Bramble, an evolutionary biologist at the
University of Utah, became\
intrigued by the theories of his former grad student David Carrier, the
first person to publish a connection between evolution, our unique human
physiology and running. Carrier's conjecture: That our ancestors, the
semisimian Australopithecus, pulled their knuckles off the dirt and
became bipedal not to free their hands to carry weapons\
(as hunters) or to carry supplies (as gatherers) but to open their lungs
in order to breathe -- and thus, run -- better.

The idea gained little traction in the scientific community. For
starters, it went against every anthropology textbook ever printed.
Years later, when the theory was first mentioned to\
C. Richard Taylor of Harvard, one of the world's leading experts on
animal locomotion, he thought the whole thing sounded, in a word,
"stupid." Evolution suggests that animals who have adapted best to their
environment develop an advantage as a species. What advantage could
running hold for humans who, over short distances, are among the slowest
mammals? Bolt, the fastest man on the planet, would get caught by a lion
in less than 20 seconds. Looking at raw speed instead of relative speed
or endurance, it was hard to see a competitive upside for primitive man
to run.

As a runner, though, Bramble was intrigued enough by Carrier's theory\
to determine if humans shared any unique attributes with running
mammals, like cheetahs, rather than with walkers, like chimps. As part
of his research, he visited Harvard evolutionary anthropologist Dan
Lieberman, who was in the midst of\
studying animals that run poorly. Inside his lab at Harvard's Peabody
Museum, Lieberman had a pig on a treadmill ("Not a pretty sight," jokes
Bramble) when his guest pointed and said, "Dan, look, that pig can't
hold his head still."

That was the first of several aha! moments for the researchers, one that
led the two men to discover that pigs and other nonrunning mammals lack
what humans, horses and dogs have in their necks: the little-known
nuchal ligament that stabilizes the cranium at high speeds. This is one
of the human body's 26 unique morphological markers that Bramble and
Lieberman revealed in a breakthrough 2004 paper, "Endurance Running and
the Evolution of Homo," which ended up on the cover of Nature. "From
head to toe in humans, it all just works," says Lieberman. "We evolved
to run."

### 

ONE DAY WHILE WATCHING A PIG JOG ON A TREADMILL, BRAMBLE HAD AN *AHA!*
MOMENT -- HUMANS EVOLVED AS RUNNERS IN ORDER TO HUNT.

Need more proof? Even though we still share 95 percent or more of our
DNA with chimps, only human legs and feet are loaded with springlike
ligaments and tendons that are essential for running. Chimps, if you've
noticed, also don't have much of a gluteus maximus. In contrast, our
robust behind is not only our biggest muscle, it's also primarily used
for running, firing at the moment of foot impact as a counterbalance to
the chest that prevents us from falling on our faces. In fact, this
system gives us a relative stride length that's longer than a galloping
horse's. Our narrow waist, meanwhile, allows us to swing our arms and
run in a straight line. Even our short toes are perfect for running. If
they were just 20 percent longer, we'd need twice the amount of energy
just to push and lift our feet off the ground.

As described in "Born to Run", while conducting his research, Lieberman
became intrigued by the behavior of his dog, Vashti. The pair would
often go for jogs on hot summer afternoons. After a short distance,
though, the dog usually plopped down in the shade and refused to move,
panting like crazy in order to cool down. Quadrupeds like dogs might
have an impressive initial burst of speed, but their lack of sweat
glands means they must stop moving relatively quickly\
to pant and cool themselves. Humans, meanwhile, with sweat glands
located all over our furless bodies, can run, breathe and cool\
ourselves simultaneously, a physiological and evolutionary royal flush.
Perhaps, Lieberman thought, as he looked at his weary pet, the
evolutionary advantage that spurred early humans to become runners was
predatory in nature. He\
recalled the stories that he'd heard about African hunters using an
overheating technique to run down antelope across the scorching-hot
savannas. Was this the keystone to the entire Running Man hypothesis?
All he needed was proof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ENTER LOUIS LIEBENBERG**, the South African scientist who had studied
persistence hunting firsthand for 25 years in the Kalahari. On one hunt
in the late 1990s, Liebenberg saw men who ran down a kudu in three hours
35 minutes, traveling 35km to do so. As the hunt progressed, the
trackers seemed to enter what the scientist calls a "trancelike state."
The experience left\
Liebenberg certain that "the full picture of why we became human must
include running, it absolutely must."

Liebenberg's observance of persistence hunting helped close the logic
gap on the Running Man theory. Roughly two million years ago,
Australopithecus was short, stout and hairy with a small brain and a big
jaw. For its descendants to transform into the taller, skinnier,
brainier Homo erectus, Australopithecus would have required a steady,
heavy diet of calorie- and protein-rich meat. But how was it getting
that meat? Fossil records show that the stone-tipped spear is only
200,000 years old, and the bow and arrow dates back just 50,000 years.
That leaves a span of at least 1.8 million years when our primitive
ancestors were chowing down on game before hunting tools had even been
invented. Because our prey could run only short distances, to gain
access to that essential form of food, we developed a body that was more
efficient on two feet over long distances than our faster four-legged
prey. Over millions of years, those beneficial traits were selected,
passed on and can be found in the dozens of morphological markers for
running in modern man. All of which has led some scientists to\
rethink the birth of -- and the limits to -- human speed and endurance.

### 

OVER SHORT DISTANCES, HUMANS RANK AMONG THE SLOWEST MAMMALS. EVEN
WORLD-RECORD HOLDER USAIN BOLT WOULD GET CAUGHT BY A LION IN LESS THAN
20 SECONDS.

As a result, new theories on the equipment and nutritional requirements
of runners have begun to take root. In fact, the current barefoot and
minimalist-shoe running craze was inspired by research into the way our
hominid forebears once moved while in pursuit of prey. Organizers of the
New York City Marathon say they have seen a noticeable increase in the
barefoot trend. Membership in the Barefoot Runners Society, meanwhile,
has doubled since 2009, though this group still represents a tiny
fraction of the total running population.\
What's more, since the original runners were persistence hunters in the
extreme heat of Africa, physician and renowned author Tim\
Noakes has developed a theory that could put a major dent in the
sports-drink industry. For\
millions of years, hunters typically ran for hours while drinking only
what they could\
carry inside an ostrich egg, usually less than\
1.5 liters of water. Likewise, Noakes found that the best modern-day
runners on the planet,\
like marathon world record-holder Haile\
Gebrselassie, aren't the ones hyperhydrating with fancy sports drinks;
they're the ones who can go the farthest while drinking the least.

"We have to explain all of these amazing\
features that make us good at running, and\
persistence hunting is the most obvious," says Harvard's Lieberman.
"Nobody had ever really thought that running was all that important in
human evolution. But no one else was making this argument, so we kept
asking ourselves, Are we crazy? Are we missing something?"

Skeptics of the theory say yes on both counts despite substantial
ethnographic proof that persistence hunting was used by many cultures
all over the planet, including the Papago Indians of the American
Southwest, the Tarahumara\
of Mexico and the Australian Aborigine. Opponents suggest that millions
of years ago, the African plains were too lush to run through, that the
theory overemphasizes the importance of meat in primitive man's diet and
development, that most of the physiological markers could have been for
walking, not running, and that the energy cost for chasing an antelope
would have far exceeded the calories gained\
by consuming the meat. "Utter rubbish," says\
Noakes. "Scientists learn one way, and the cost and energy of changing
that thinking becomes so high it is not feasible for them. When you take
all this data in with an open mind, there's just no other explanation:
We evolved as runners."\
It's a conclusion that gets even harder to argue while watching the
predatory runners\
of the !Xo San tribe in action. For hours, the running men float
effortlessly, like ghosts, across one of the harshest climates on earth.
And when they see erratic tracks in the sand indicating that the kudu is
tiring, they lock on to their prey like a guided missile. They call
themselves "sons of the first people," and their focus seems almost
primordial.

The hunt ends when Karoha walks up to the animal and plunges a
rudimentary wood spear into its chest -- an act that is largely
ceremonial. Karoha then kneels and quietly honors the kudu by
ritualistically spreading sand over its body and transferring saliva
from the antelope's mouth onto his own exhausted and burning legs. On
Karoha's face, and especially in his dark eyes, there is a solemn sense
of relief and joy. As it has for millennia, this successful persistence
hunt means his children will eat and grow, as will his standing in the
tribe.

In the end, what the filmmakers thought would be the most disturbing
part of the documentary, the graphic death of an animal, turned out to
be the most touching and transcendent. At the movie's debut, the scene
with Karoha and the kudu left many audience members in tears. Foster
believes that witnessing a persistence hunt evokes an undeniable
connection to our primal, predatory running past.

"People were overcome," he says, "because they were seeing a deep,
important part of themselves that they never knew existed."
