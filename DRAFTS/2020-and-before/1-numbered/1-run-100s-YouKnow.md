    During today's beautiful 32 mile run on the Pacific Crest Trail, several
    runners and I were telling the usual jokes.  We started in on the
    "You know you're a redneck if" variety.  This quickly developed into
    "You know you're an Ultrarunner if" jokes.  Here are a few that my
    tired mind can remember.  Let's have a little fun on the lists and add a
    few of your own.  After all ultrarunning is about having fun.  Isn't it?

    You know you're an Ultrarunner if:

    1) Your wife tries to introduce you to your three children and you
    reply "Three?"
    2) You spend more time in the drug section  than the food section of the
    local market.
    3) You wonder why they don't make all running socks a dusty brown color.
    4) You have more dirt on your shoes than in your garden.
    5) You think that flagel and ibutrophin belong on the breakfast table.
    6) You get more phone calls at 5:00 AM than at 5:00 PM.
    7) You don't recognize your friends with their clothes on.
    8) You have more buckles than belts.
    9) You postpone your wedding because it will interfere with your training.
    10) You keep mistaking your boss for Norm Klein.

    * your idea of a fun date is a 30-mile training run
    * you're tempted to look for a bush when there's a long line for the
    public restroom
    * you don't think twice about eating food you've picked up off the floor
    * you can expound on the virtues of eating salt
    * you develop an unnatural fear of mountain lions

        Your ideal way to celebrate your birthday is to run at least your
        age in miles with some fellow crazies.

        Your ideal way to celebrate the new year is to run as far as you
        can afford to with some fellow crazies.

        Your ideal way to have fun is to run as far as you can afford to
        with some fellow crazies.

        You know the location of every 7-11, public restroom, and
        water fountain within a 25-mile radius of your house.

        You run marathons for speedwork.

        You have more fanny packs and water bottles and flashlights than
        Imelda Marcos has shoes.

        You visit a national park with your family and notice a thirty-mile
        trail connecting where you are with the place your family wants to
        visit next, which is a 100-mile drive away, and you think "Hmmmm".

        Someone asks you how long your training run is going to be and you
        answer "seven or eight ... hours".

        People at work think you're in a whole lot better shape than you
        think you are.

        You actually are in a whole lot better shape than you think you are.

        Your weekend runs are limited by how much time you have, not by
        how far you can run.

        You always have at least one black toenail.

        You buy economy-sized jars of Vaseline on a regular basis.

        You tried hashing, but felt the trails were too short and easy.

        You think of pavement as a necessary evil that connects trails.

        You read this message.

    You know you are an ultrarunner when you get to the 81 mile point of a 100
    miler and say to yourself, "Wow, only 19 miles left!"

    1. You try to tie double knots in your Oxfords.
    2. You pass a swamp towards the end of a run and think 'How bad could it be?"

    You know you're an ultrarunner if your wife/girlfriend/significant other
    asks you if you want to have sex on any particular night and you respond with:

    "sorry, i don't have time, i have to go running"
    "sorry, i'm too tired, i just went running"
    "sorry, i would rather go read all my messages from the ultra-list"

    You know you are an ultrarunner if...

    ...You number your running shoes to distinguish old from new, since they all
    look dirty.

    ...Prior to running a difficult race, you check to see if local hospitals and
    urgent care centers are in your PPO.

    ...The only time major household projects get done is in a taper or race
    recovery.

    You know you are an ultra parent if...

    ... Your 6 year old knows the difference between a 100k and 100 miler.

    ...Whenever you anounce an exciting family vacation, the first question is
    "Where is the race?"

    You know you are an ultraWOMAN if...

    ...You have more fanny packs than purses.

    ... You have the complete collection of every "long lasting" lip color ever made.

    ...You have a walk-in closet dedicated to running apparel.

    ...You have a permanent combination scar/tan in the outline of a jogbra.

    You know you are an ultra runner if...

    you call a 50-mile race "just another training run".

    you think a 100-mile race is easier than a 50 miler because you don't have to go out
    as fast.

    you say, "Taper? Who's got time to taper? I have a race coming up this weekend."

    Ya know your an ultrarunner when:

    1.  You use your local 5 and 10km's for "speed work."
    2.  On a long drive you see the road signs listing various mileages to different places and think of how long it would take to get there on foot rather than by the car your driving.
    3.  You've started a race in the dark, run all day, and finished in the dark (if your lucky).
    4.  Your non-Ultrarunning running friends look at you strange when you tell them that 10:00/Mile is a fast pace for a 100 mile race (not to mention most ultras).
    5.  You don't hesitate to lie down in the trail (anywhere) when you are falling asleep on your feet during the early morning hours on the second day of a 100 miler; and it feels so comfortable.

    You know your an ultra runner when you meet someone of the opposite sex on
    the trail of a 100 and all of conversation is about
    what color is your urine, can you drink? and were you able to dump.

    Ya know you're and ultra runner when a girl changes her tank and her bra in
    front of you and all you do is take another drink of water, look at your
    watch, get up and tell your pacer "Let's hit the trail."

    Or...You know you're a "Real" ultrarunner when you actually DO drive a stick
    shift home with a severely pulled left hamstring, as I did in May driving
    home from Quicksilver 50K in San Jose to San Francisco.  Clutching with a
    pulled hamstring is a true test of one's pain threshold, and mine is rather
    low even with minor irritations.  If I had videotaped my facial contortions
    and screaming sound effects on that drive home, the tape could have easily
    been used in some horror flick!
