Minimalist Footwear. 
====================

Many people seem interested in the shoes I wear, so I thought I’d write
a post here so that my stock answer is in one place instead of writing
the same thing over and over again. So, here goes: my running footwear
history/philosophy.
I’ve been running in something other than conventional trainers for
almost four years now. My initial interest in wearing a more basic,
simple, lightweight, low-profile shoe occurred when a physical therapist
prescribed rock-hard fiberglass custom orthotics and motion control
shoes for me to get over some chronic hip problems I was having in my
sophomore year of high school (1999). At the time, I was excited because
the new inserts seemed to help immensely to keep me injury-free, but in
the back of my mind was the previous years of empirical evidence that I
had that suggested that a more simple mode of footwear was sufficient.

When I started running in 1995 I wore a pair of circa 1980 Nike Waffle
Trainers (something like the Nike Cortez’s) that I picked up in a
Goodwill store for a dollar or so. I ended up putting about 3000 miles
on these shoes before the sole completely separated from the upper and
Shoe Goo wouldn’t hold it anymore. Over the year and a half or so that I
wore these shoes (including finishing my first marathon in 3:50:11 at
age 12 in Okoboji, IA) I was tiny–about 4’10” and 75-80 lbs. Yet, in
later years, I could never get out of my mind the thought that I ran all
of those miles injury-free in such a simple shoe; nor could I ignore all
of the historical photos I saw of runners from the 1960s and 1970s
racing and training in completely flat-soled shoes with little to no
cushioning. I read about Frank Shorter, Jeff Galloway, and Jack Bacheler
logging 170+ mile weeks in Vail, CO in preparation for the 1972 Olympic
Trials and then would see pictures of them on training runs wearing
basically racing flats.

However, it wasn’t until early 2004 when a good friend of mine on the
Colorado College XC team, [[Kiran
Moorty](http://web.archive.org/web/20090424073039/http://www.dcrunner.org/kiranmoortyinterview.htm)]{style="color: blue; font-family: georgia;"},
started talking about the benefits of running in “minimalist” shoes that
I started actively researching the notion and worked up enough interest
to pursue the concept myself. (Notice Kiran racing barefoot in that
link–he went on to finish about seven seconds out of All-American in
that race. Another good friend of mine, [Julian
Boggs](http://www.trackshark.com/blogs/division3blog/2011/Interview:+Julian+Boggs+of+Colorado+College.html),
finished 3rd at NCAA Div. III XC Nationals last year running barefoot.
Boggs also paced for me in the 2006 LT100.)

Up until that spring, I’d run exclusively in motion-control or stability
shoes with the same fiberglass custom orthotics. But, I was becoming
pretty fed up with the clunkiness and general unwieldy nature of my
footwear/orthotics and was simultaneously becoming interested in the
apparent injury-prevention benefits of running in very minimal, flexible
shoes. This led to doing research on the evolution of running, human
physiology, primitive running tribes, etc. to the point that I
thought–despite the risks–I should give it a shot myself.

Starting in March of 2004 I gradually started doing runs without my
orthotics. I began with maybe 30 minutes a few times a week and over the
course of 2 weeks or so built up to doing all of my running(100-120mpw
at the time) without the orthotics. I was wearing the [[Asics GT
2070s]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.runningnetwork.com/images/productreviews/ASICSGel2070s02.jpg)
at the time. At the end of this period I had one 21 mile long run where
I started out with the orthotics in, but my lower legs hurt so I took
them out after 3 miles and my legs immediately felt better and my pace
instantly dropped over 30 seconds per mile. It was one of the most
amazing, epiphanal runs of my life.  At this same time, I began to
consciously pay attention to my form.  I was traditionally a full-on
heel-striker, but now began trying to run with a shorter, quicker,
lighter stride, higher cadence, and more of a mid-foot/fore-foot strike.

From there I went to an alleged racing flat–the [[Nike TC
Triax]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://is1.cyberfenix.net/zapas/fotos/nike%20tc%20triax.jpg)[
(now discontinued, but it is on the beefier side…I would compare it to
the present-day ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[Nike
Marathoners]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.runnersworld.com.au/nike_air_zoom_marathoner.jpg)[).
The move to these was fairly quick–less than a week–and then over the
course of the next month I moved down to
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[Asics
DS-Racers]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.kmsport.it/images/asics%20ds%20racer.jpg)[
and then the ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[New Balance
240s]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.2jfk.com/pictures/nb_240.jpg)[…a
very light, flexible flat. The New Balances were the first shoe I cut
the heel off of in order to make it equal to the forefoot height so as
to increase ankle mobility in my running gait. I was fully transitioned
into the New Balances by the middle of June of 2004–a full three months
after I’d first started ditching my orthotics; to be sure, it’s a slow
process. I also did a lot of running in the
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[Asics 15-50
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://bilder3.preissuchmaschine.de/prodfoto/1550spike.jpg)XC
flat during this time.

In May, I started doing some barefoot running to further strengthen my
feet and aid in making the minimalist transition. Initially, this was
only 10minutes or so–all on grass–tacked onto the ends of my usual
training runs. I also started going barefoot as much as possible in
every-day life (walking around campus, going to class, getting kicked
out of a lot of stores, etc.). By the end of June I was up to 30 minute
runs completely barefoot, and by August I was completely comfortable
doing hour runs totally barefoot (still, all on grass/dirt with small
amounts of pavement). During that summer I also did a lot of “nearly
barefoot” hiking on all sorts of terrain in a pair of water socks that
were basically less sophisticated versions of the [Vibram
FiveFingers](http://barefootted.com/uploaded_images/SprintHero-731609.jpg).
I summitted [[Humphreys
Peak]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.peakware.com/photos/115c.jpg)[
in Arizona, hiked the ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[North Bright
Angel
trail]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://sps.berkeley.edu/~bswift/pictures/GrandCyn040625-27/GrandCyn040625-27_025.jpg)[
to Phantom Ranch and back, and hiked to
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[Havasu
Falls]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://sps.berkeley.edu/~bswift/pictures/HavasuFalls040724-25/HavasuFalls_065.jpg)
and back (20 miles roundtrip) in my water socks (I was living in
Flagstaff, AZ that summer).

In August, I started running in [[Puma
H-Streets]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.cbueno.com/images/tn_IMG_8177.jpg)[
very regularly—basically for all of my running. These are absolutely
beautiful minimalist shoes that are, unfortunately, discontinued. They
have been updated with the ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[Puma
Saloh]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.zappos.com/n/multi_view.cgi?product_id=7326833&color_id=13910&view=multi)[
that I am interested in trying out but I’m not interested in all of the
new synthetic overlays. The H Street was such a great shoe (I would put
1000-1500 miles on a pair–long after my foot would start poking out the
side of the upper) that I never really endeavored to go for anything
lower than this. I once ran to the top of Pikes Peak and back in the H
Streets, but couldn’t go as fast as I wanted on the way down because of
the lack of protection. However, in the spring/summer of 2005 I logged
several 200 mile weeks and a couple 30 and 40 milers in nothing but H
Streets. Their main drawback was their lack of traction. The outsole was
nothing but little nubbins that I would wear down fairly quickly.
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[These
shoes]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.zappos.com/n/multi_view.cgi?product_id=7331254&color_id=107129&view=multi)
look to me to be a good update to the H Street with greater traction and
durability (but, probaby a bit heavier).

So, for me, the meat of the transition (down to truly “flat” shoes and
substantial barefoot running) took 3-4 months.

When I hear people say that they could never run in more minimal
shoes–that it would tear their body up–I agree, because without the
proper adapation period immediately starting to run in flatter, more
flexible shoes for all of their running would be a horrible idea.
Transitioning to these types of shoes should include a gradual enough
increase in workload that the feet/legs are never unduly sore. It’s a
matter of astutely listening to one’s body.\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[So, one might ask, why don’t you do all of your running in the Puma H
Streets or a cross-country flat (if I’m so in love with those shoes)?
Well, because I’ve found that running on rocky trails does indeed
require a bit of protection, too, *if I want to be able to run as fast
as I possibly can over that terrain.* Up until July of 2006 I was doing
all of my running either barefoot, in water socks, or in the H Streets
or some XC flats. However, in the Leadville Marathon that year I bruised
my forefoot while bombing down the exceedingly rocky descent in that
race while wearing the [Puma La
Bamba](http://www.zappos.com/n/multi_view.cgi?product_id=7255736&color_id=84840&view=multi).
These shoes have even thinner forefoots than it looks in the
picture.]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
I decided that if I wanted to continue running and racing the Rocky
Mountain trails that I love I needed a little bit more protection. So, I
went out and bought a pair of [La Sportiva
Slingshots](http://www.bambooshoots.co.jp/shop/shoes-more/img/sportiva-slingshot-red05.jpg)–still
the beefiest shoes I’ve run in in the past four years. Although they
aren’t my absolutely ideal shoe, they are definitely one of the best
things out there in the trail running market that I’ve found. I really
like their thin midsole through the midfoot and forefoot, but the heel
is still too built up for me, so that’s where my major modification
comes in.

To lower the heel, I take a serrated kitchen knife and slice off the
outsole and a lot of the midsole of the back half of the shoe. I
basically start right behind the grey, hard plastic external heel
counter and then cut all the way up until about the “Frixion” logo in
the midfoot portion of the outsole. This way, the sole thickness is
pretty much even all the way from the forefoot to the rearfoot.\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
The other things I do to the Slingshots is cut an inch or so off the top
of the tongue and then pull all the foam padding out of the tongue; I
like the fit better and it cuts weight and doesn’t soak up as much
water. I also remove the insoles to reduce weight and have a better feel
for the trail.

With the Slingshots, I would much prefer a more “racing flat” fit and
feel to them, more akin with a road shoe, but it seems almost every
company is kind of averse to this. I suspect they’re afraid of cramping
the toebox so that people don’t lose toenails or that they think the
upper materials necessary for such a fit aren’t durable enough. However,
I wore the Slingshots in both the 2006 Leadville Trail 100 and the 2007
Rocky Raccoon 100.\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[The other shoe that I’ve been very happy with is the [Inov-8 f-lite
250](http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_mall/kenko-keikaku/cabinet/1_917/093.jpg).
This shoe best mimics the racing flat type fit that I’ve been looking
for in a trail running shoe. I also shave a bit off the heel of these
and remove the insoles. I wore these shoes quite satisfactorily in the
2007 Leadville Trail 100.]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
I end up wearing the Sportivas and Inov-8s for my typical morning
mountain runs of 3hrs or longer and I wear a dilapidated pair of Puma H
Streets for my evening runs of 1-2hrs on less gnarly trails. I am
looking forward to trying out the Vibram FiveFingers as an alternative
to barefoot in colder climates (I now live in Bozeman, afterall) and,
hopefully, for my evening runs as a replacement to the H Streets.

What are the reasons for wanting to run in minimalist shoes? Almost all
shoes (even many racing flats) have an unnecessary amount of rise from
the forefoot to the rearfoot. By training in a shoe with this sort of
heel lift, the Achilles tendon is constantly shortened and underworked
with each step. The raised heel also limits the range of motion in the
ankle upon footstrike and promotes a heelstrike instead of a more
midfoot or forefoot initial footplant. \
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[One’s footplant while running barefoot is much different than while
running with shoes. If one were to run barefoot across a stretch of
asphalt, I guarantee that he or she wouldn’t run with a heelstrike for
very long! Thus, a big motivating factor—for me—in wearing minimalist
shoes is to encourage my body to adopt a running gait (shorter, quicker
strides that land closer to the body’s center of mass) that will allow
my feet to take advantage of the most natural cushioning mechanism that
was built into our anatomy—the resilience of the Achilles tendon, calf
muscles, and ankle joint. ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[Running with a fore-to-midfoot strike in minimalist shoes almost
completely disallows overstriding; increases one’s agility on uneven
terrain (a definite plus in trail running); strengthens all of the often
overlooked supportive muscles, tendons and ligaments of the feet and
lower legs; and, in the end, hopefully cultivates a more propulsive,
strong, less injury-prone stride. Decent slow-motion shots of the kind
of footplant and running style I’m talking about can be seen in this
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[video
clip]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.negativesplit.net/indulge/trailer.html)[.
(For a better look, download the file
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}[[here]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.negativesplit.net/indulge/trailers.html).)
If one looks closely, he or she can see that the initial contact with
the ground is with my outer forefoot; I then roll in, touch down with my
heel, and push off (I’m not just running exclusively “on my toes”).

Additionally, I am a big proponent of simplifying my life (and thus, my
running), and believe that the human body was meant to run, and that
simple biological evolution couldn’t have been so wrong, so why not let
the foot and lower leg do what it was designed to do ([[I’ve read many
peer-reviewed articles that have concluded that the human body evolved
to
run]{style="font-family: georgia;"}](http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041117/full/news041115-9.html)[)
and not inhibit it with some big clunky
shoe? ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[\
]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[Of course, basically from birth, the majority of the human population
is corrupted by being placed in very “supportive” almost cast-like shoes
and our feet and lower legs become very weak. I myself used to run in
so-called stability shoes with hard plastic, custom orthotics, but over
the past three years I’ve tried–and succeeded in–leaving those
albatrosses behind. ]{style="font-family: georgia;"}\
[Because so many folks have grown up wearing shoes and the medical
industry constantly pushes more and more restrictive orthotics and shoes
that simply weaken the foot further, most people can’t imagine running
hundreds and thousands of miles over rocky trails in such flimsy flats
as I do. It’s something that needs to be worked up to **gradually**, but
I believe that as long as the running surface is natural (no concrete,
asphalt, etc.) the human foot is well-designed to handle any running
stress we’re willing to impart on it (**provided you give it enough
adaptive time**).]{style="font-family: georgia;"}

    Tony,

    Ideally, I agree with you, but do you think this kind of approach
    can work for those of us not blessed with great biomechanics? Do you
    think the body can still adapt to running a lot of miles in
    minimalist footwear?

    I ask because I’ve also been working towards wearing more
    lightweight flexible shoes over the years (the Inov-8 Roclite 305 is
    my current 100-mile shoe of choice). But I find that if I spend too
    much time (especially on roads) in flats or lightweight trainers I
    always start to get medial knee pain – which I’m guessing is because
    of my leg-length imbalance and just slightly non-neutral footplant.

    I know you said you used to wear orthotics – what was that for? I’m
    just wondering if there are some biomechanics for which minimalist
    footwear will never work.

    Thoughts?

    Hi Jasper,\
    I really don’t know how barefoot running would work for someone with
    less than perfect mechanics. Apparently, a number of medical
    professionals thought that I didn’t have perfect, neutral mechanics,
    or else I don’t know why they would’ve fit me with custom orthotics
    and told me to wear them the rest of my life.

    One thing I do know about “stability” and motion control, though, is
    that once the foot isn’t elevated on the high platform of a typical
    running shoe, it is inherently a lot more stable. BUT, i’m by no
    means an expert on any of this and don’t know how anyone else’s body
    would respond to the things i’ve done to mine.

    So, i’m not sure what to suggest. It seems like you’re experimenting
    and seeing where your limits are, and that’s about all i could
    suggest to do. The only other thing I can say is just to reiterate
    that any transition needs to be a gradual process–it can’t be rushed
    and you have to listen to your body.

    Thanks Tony for such a detailed write up. Hopefully you will enjoy
    the Vibram FiveFingers as much as I have. You may need to wear the
    Surge during the coldest days. They are bulky compared to the Sprint
    or Classic, but they at least have 2mm of neoprene to keep those
    toes a little warmer.

    Enjoy!

    Hello,

    As you first post suggests — I am one of those people who have
    interest in what you have to say…

    I am curious… footwear is always a point of interest… is eating
    habits another? What does the typical daily diet look like…

    Sorry for the mundane… but inquiring minds want to know!

    Thanks

    Tony,

    I loved this post!\
    I don’t have the biomechanically-perfect body for running long
    distances, (supposedly)…I’ve got flat feet, asthma, and a previous
    history of multiple foot and toe bone breaks from my martial arts
    days.\
    My podiatrist(s) in the past put me in hard orthotics and I
    gravitated to clunky motion-control shoes. I ran on pavement for
    many years, and had continual-chronic injuries…PF, sciatica, knee
    issues, etc.

    I started running on trails exclusively a few years ago. Almost
    right away, I needed a lower-heeled, and more flexible shoe; I also
    got rid of the orthotics, as I found them counter-productive on the
    trails. It was like a miracle. ALL of my chronic injuries went away.
    I even started a [trailrunning group](http://www.psychowyco.com/),
    because of my newly found “path” in life.

    While I can’t get away with super-minimalist shoes like you, I do
    gravitate to the lightest, most flexible trail shoes that I can find
    (that fit my huge, flat feet).

    So, I would add that humans evolved to run long distances (to
    run-down game); we are the ruling “long-distance running species” on
    this planet. But we were “biomechanically” never meant to run on
    ARTIFICIALLY FLAT AND HARD SURFACES like pavement and concrete. Our
    bodies adapt to trailrunning, because it is the natural thing to do.

    Happy trails,\
    [Bad Ben](http://badbenkc.blogspot.com/)

    PS: I really enjoyed seeing you run at RR100, this past Feb. I was
    having a tough day, but still managed to finish my 5th RR100 in a
    row.

    Tony,

    Enjoyed reading your post. Very inspirational. I’ve been running
    barefoot exclusively for 8 1/2 years and can’t even imagine running
    with shoes any more. I’m not a long distance runner like you and at
    45 years of age, don’t have the unlimited energy I had as a 20 year
    old. Nevertheless, I still love to run (mainly because it’s fun and
    enjoyable, especially barefoot) and I run several times a week. I’ve
    completed a half marathon and a 10 miler barefoot and plan on
    running a marathon someday.

    Your comments all line up nicely with what I’ve been reading over
    the years on the running barefoot group on Yahoo. I’ve not had any
    problems running on asphalt or concrete, although I do prefer a
    variety of running surfaces – especially a wet sandy beach!

    Look forward to your future stories/comments.

    Victor

    Anton,\
    It is very refreshing to read a write-up on minimalist footwear from
    an incredible and accomplished ultra-runner.\
    I am a barefoot and minimalist runner and mostly use Barefoot Ted’s
    Huaraches or Five Finger’s.\
    I am not at the point where I can race 100s completely barefoot or
    in huaraches, so I was very glad to see your Slingshot
    modifications. I have a pair of FireBlades I bought for racing, but
    they are still high heels. I will spend my afternoon modifying them.

    This doesn’t really have anything to do with this thread but I was
    wondering if you could tell us about some of your favorite books, I
    think that everyone would be interested in seeing some of the books
    that have shaped your personality as well as your world view and
    why!

    Thanks again for all your posts they are very interesting and
    motivating!

    Tony, I’m just curious: when you got your stress fracture in your
    metatarsal, did your minimalist footwear practices come into
    question at all, either by you or, say, anyone else? I assume
    something else was to blame, like not giving it enough of the
    adaptive time you mention? I wish you continued, rapid healing.

    Just a quick question or two for clarification. I understand the
    need for more shoe than the H street but why not wear more of a true
    flat like your New Balance rather than the sportiva of especially
    the inov-8(which is as light as a road flat and with about the same
    traction)? I would assume that you just run shoes into the ground
    since you are not big on extra cushioning and once your foot is
    conditioned there is no need to swap shoes every 500 miles, etc?

    Tony,

    I know this is an old post, but Irunfar Bryon has linked to it and I
    found it very interesting. I too was fitted into ridgid orthotics
    and stability shoes. I found the orthotics to make me feet weak and
    as soon as I tried to do anything barefoot I was screwed with pain
    from my slight tarsal coalition. This really flared up just before
    my attempt at Massanutten this year. I wore the orthotics in that
    race and ended up dropping at 70 miles from foot pain. I have
    stopped using the orthotics and have had no issue since. I am always
    bear foot when it is feasible. You have inspired me to break the
    mold and slowly try to transitions into a more minimal / neutral
    shoe.

    Thanks man, Keep running hard!

    Fantastic blog! I have recently decided to find a running style and
    philosophy, if you will, that makes sense in the most natural of
    ways. I think your head is in the right spot on this one and I plan
    on looking into it further!

    great write-up. i just linked over here from irunfar.

    after wearing orthotics for the past two years i spent the summer
    running and racing without them. prior to the summer i had worked
    with a physical therapist to improve my gait with a more neutral
    footstrike and stride like what you talk about.

    my feet felt fine and i had no problems until two weeks after my
    last race (24 mile trail run). at that time my inner ankle starting
    having pain upon raising my toes.

    now, according to an orthopedist, i have pulled an ankle tendon and
    have been prescribed new orthotics which i am supposed to never be
    without.

    in your opinion, should i wait until the tendon no longer hurts and
    then start back with minimal footwear running? i’m at a loss b/c i
    want to be able to run without the klunkiness but also without
    injury and pain…

    any advice would be awesome. thanks!

    I’m a Certified Pedorthist and just posted a blog entry about
    minimalist footwear. As successful as your experience has been with
    this type of shoe, some athletes have extenuating conditions that
    don’t make this the best running shoe technology for them. Check out
    my post for more info.\

    Hi Tony and everyone,

    As a barefoot running coach, I’ve found that people who are NOT
    blessed with “perfect” biomechanics need to go the minimalist
    approach the most. That’s because the minimal approach helps you to
    feel the ground and find a softer, better stride. Studies show that
    cushioned shoes create a poor stride (heel strike) and are quite
    damaging to the feet and knees over time…the studies show we’re
    putting 200 to 300% more force down on the ground in a heavily
    cushioned shoe than a minimalist one or barefoot…

    That kind of force doesn’t lie…if you’re not ‘perfect’…it’s the
    SHOES that will beat you up.

    Go minimalist…feel the ground and you’ll begin to tread lightly and
    find your own perfect form!

    Wow, an aging post revived.

    I am 6-0 and about 200. This July I ran the Pacifica 50K in my very
    favorite Nike Katana Rac3r III flats. They were wonderful. Of course
    some granite sections had me scampering a little more than usual but
    otherwise there were no issues. The “charts that be” tell me I
    should be in a stability shoe for over pronators, though they have
    done nothing but hurt my running. It took me about 6 months (maybe a
    little less) to taper down to running in flats but it was well worth
    it. It forced me to correct my form, and as a result, a lingering
    hip issue (rt leg) and knee issue (lft leg) have disappeared. I run
    much more efficiently as well. I can’t imagine running in the junk I
    used before. I do have a pair of Brooks Launch’s (neutral cushion)
    that I will be using for the Dick Collins this weekend but only
    because I am nursing a “blister-gone-bad” I gave myself while
    playing doctor. Other than that, it’s the Katana’s, Adios and soon
    to be out mt100s if they fit well. Anyway, great post and thread.

    Mike S.

    Thank you for this post! Any thoughts on trying barefoot running on
    a treadmill for those of us that live in cold, urban environments? I
    sustained a bad hip injury last season which I believe is from weak
    feet and years of heel striking in overly cushioned shoes, so I’m
    going to make the transition. Thank you for sharing your experience.

    Tony,

    It’s particularly interesting how you alter your shoes. I agree that the number one issue with running and trail running shoes is the raised heel. You deal with that problem by simply slicing off the soles under the heels of your shoes. We need more flat soled running shoes in the market. My solution is wearing a minimalist shoe that isn’t even meant for running, SANUK shoes. You can check out other minimalist shoes at [barefoot footwear](http://www.barefootmotion.com/barefoot-footwear.html).

    Your experience is similar to mine. I remember those ol nike
    trainers and elites..ran 100 mile weeks injury free forever. The
    more bells and whistles and ‘control’ added to shoes the more
    injuries to follow.\
    At any rate I’ve enjoyed the Nike Frees since they came out, in
    particular the 3.0’s but alas those are hard to find now and
    honestly I like adidas. I’ve had several pair of the adizero xt
    trail shoes but still wish they get rid of that darn rigid internal
    heel cup and make the shoe more flexible. If you know of any adidas
    shoe that is proximate to the free let me know.

    You really must try huaraches. I make one slightly bigger than my
    foot, have no knots under the toe becuase I use climbers tape and
    two holes at the front and sides to pull the climbers tape through
    to lock it.I run on trails, did 70km of Australias’s toughest 175km
    GNW run in them but had to pull out when I got lost (and tired).

    Anyway you’ll find after about 6 months of fiddling with huaraches
    you’ll get them absolutely perfect.

    what counts as minimalist shoes anyway these days.. I do agree that
    the vibrams are very minimalist but what about other shoes that have
    light properties like the [vivo
    barefoot](http://barefootrunningshoes.org/vivo-barefoot-shoes/)
    shoes or the newton running shoes listed
    [here](http://barefootrunningshoes.org/newton-running-shoes/) as

    Hi – internet just lost my original post so I’ll type it all over
    again! I’m a Traditional Runner (I use this as it describes the
    style better than Minimalist) and use 1940’s style plimsolls (see
    link) to run on the Malvern Hills in the UK. They’re unbelievably
    cheap and simple – flat rubber sole with a single layer canvas
    upper. Our Fell Running hero Bob Graham
    (<http://www.bobgrahamclub.co.uk/bobgrahamround.co.uk/> and
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Graham_Round>)did his epic Bob
    Graham Round in 1932 in a pair of these after recceing each hill
    barefoot to save on wear of his precious shoes! Fabulous, original,
    authentic and injury-free. The ulimate… All the very best everyone
    and thanks for all you do Anton. Dave.

    You should try Mizuno Wave Universe 3’s. 3.6 oz. I just wore them on
    a rugged Bandit 50k in Simi Valley, CA and pounded the downhills
    with rocks and all at 5:00 m/m. My feet never felt better. Open toe
    box, my toes actually do “work.” I run 100+ during the week and they
    provide traction, minimal protection from rocks and stones but still
    allow you to feel the run… josh

    I recently started wearing a very cheap pair of sneakers (\$5) for
    short runs. They have almost no arch support and very thin flexible
    sole. I like them a lot better than my VFF’s. The question is this:
    One can easily spend up to \$200 for some of these minimalist shoes.
    Why? Are a \$200pair of Newtons really better than my \$5 sneakers?

With all these $100-200 "minimilist" shoes on the market, I ask, how are they better than my $5 shoes? There’s no doubt they are more attractive, but for $5, I’m not complaining.
