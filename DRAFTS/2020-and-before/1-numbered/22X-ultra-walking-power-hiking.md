We’re off to the races for July and that means many in the ultrarunning
tribe will soon be tackling long training runs and races in the
mountains. One strategy that’s often overlooked and misunderstood in
mountain running is walking up hills.

You may hear runners say things like, “My main goal is to not walk a
step” or “I made it all the way up the climb without walking.” You may
even be saying and thinking these things yourself. I recommend athletes
stop to consider whether or not running every single step is actually
the wisest – and fastest –\
strategy. If you have a hang-\
up about walking up hills in races, try re-scripting: “walking” becomes
“powerhiking.” OK, now that sounds better!

Powerhiking up hills, especially ones that are steep and/or later in a
race, is often more efficient (requires less effort and a lower heart
rate at the same pace) and effective (*faster* movement at the same
heart rate) than running.

Consider Your Powerhiking Form

The best mountain runners use a range of techniques and cadences
throughout the course of a race. When powerhiking without poles, you can
swing your arms in unison with your steps. Or (especially on steeps) put
your hands on your quads and push down on each step; this can create a
fast and powerful motion when combined with longer strides. Bending over
to push on the quads with the hands can stress the back and should
therefore be practiced extensively before using for hours in a race.
Stride length and cadence can be varied as well; compare short, fast
steps to long, slower ones. Whether you’re running or powerhiking or
both, 

###### altering technique from time to time in long races may be helpful.

Try Using Poles

Some running purists eschew the European geeksticks, but I find them to
be extremely helpful for ascending and descending steep terrain. Poles
provide a boost and transfer of power when climbing and ease the
pounding when descending. I choose one of three poling techniques
depending on terrain, speed and which body parts need a rest.

1.  What’s probably the most common technique involves poling in unison
    with footsteps such that the right pole plants and pushes with the
    left foot and vice versa.

-   On the really steep stuff, I use both poles at once by planting them
    way up ahead (hands well above head level upon planting) and then
    pulling the body through and past the plant-point before extending
    the arms backwards to push with the triceps, with many steps
    occurring between each planting of the poles.
-   In a variation of \#2 that may work well when running uphill or
    down, mimic the poling of skateskiing, wherein one pole lands and
    pushes off just a split second before the other.

Test it Out

On your next hilly long run, test a bit of powerhiking after your legs
have taken on some fatigue. If you like to “go by feel,” then simply
scroll through the techniques above, feeling out which one(s) are the
most effective for you. If you’re more scientific, then ascend the same
climb (ideally one that mimics the grade, footing and altitude of your
upcoming race) numerous times at the same heart rate, varying the
powerhiking technique on each ascent. Record the times and see which
ones are fastest for you. Be sure to include running as well. For a test
like this, you might limit the climbing segment to 10 minutes or so to
cut down on cumulative fatigue from additional ascents. To really geek
out, repeat the test on a range of grades to determine which running or
powerhiking option should be used when.

Take to the Stairs

You may well not have access to steep trails for training even though
your out-of-state race will be full of them. In this case, move to the
mountains. But if that’s not feasible consider using a treadmill, stair
climber or stairs to practice your powerhiking techniques. Though
potentially awkward and uncomfortable, stairwells in tall buildings may
be the best option because they allow for exploring short strides (hit
every stair) vs. long strides (every second or third stair) and force
the athlete to prepare for descents by running or walking back down the
stairs. Stairwells may be boring, but they’re also good mental training.

As you crush it this summer in hilly ultras, remember that running the
whole way may not be in your best interest. And just like you will
practice your nutrition, pacing and gear choices, be sure to
intentionally work on your walking – I mean *powerhiking*!

    Nice info. Though I am still a plain terrain runner, would take up
    hill trails soon. I too used to think, till I read this write up,
    that walking during a Run is a no no. Thanks for correcting me. I
    have a query : are short walking breaks ok during city marathons?

        Why not? Walk when you need to…allows you to remain aerobic and
        rest your muscles temporarily. Have done it multiple times. Only
        issue is you need to stick to your guns and not feel intimidated
        that you are walking, since I’ve seldom seen walkers in a road
        race…IMHO, run trail races, way better fellow runners!

    I completed my first Mount Washington Road Race last month. I had
    concerns about how much I would need to walk and had worked out a
    strategy that had worked for shorter training runs-walk so many
    steps and power hike so many- which kept my momentum going and my
    fatigue level in check. Though I ended up power hiking about 2/3 of
    the race I still finished in my goal time and passed many very
    fatigued runners who had tried to run as much as possible. The key
    is to “make it count” when you walk. You can maintain a good pace
    that is often faster and more efficient than trying to run.
