**[Octavio Paz
Lozano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavio_Paz "w:Octavio Paz"){.extiw}**
([31 March](/wiki/31_March "31 March"){.mw-redirect}
[1914](/wiki/1914 "1914") – [19
April](/wiki/19_April "19 April"){.mw-redirect}
[1998](/wiki/1998 "1998"){.mw-disambig}) was a poet, writer, diplomat,
and winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Mexican
writer to become a Nobel Laureate.

-   There can be no [society](/wiki/Society "Society") without
    [poetry](/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"), but society can never be realized
    as poetry, it is never poetic. Sometimes the two terms seek to break
    apart. They cannot.

        The Poetic Revelation, Poetry and History* (1973) as translated
        by Ruth L.C. Simms, p. 249

    [relationship](/wiki/Relationship "Relationship"){.mw-redirect}
    between what I have called my expulsion from the
    [present](/wiki/Present "Present") and the writing of
    [poetry](/wiki/Poetry "Poetry").** Poetry is in love with the
    instant and seeks to relive it in the poem, thus separating it from
    sequential time and turning it into a fixed present. But at that
    time I wrote without wondering why I was doing it. I was searching
    for the gateway to the present: I wanted to belong to my time and to
    my century. A little later this obsession became a fixed idea: I
    wanted to be a modern poet. My search for modernity had begun.

I am the buried fire
If you are the water's mouth
I am the mouth of moss
If you are the forest of the clouds
I am the axe that parts it
If you are the profaned city

-   Between going and staying the day wavers,

in love with its own transparency.
The circular afternoon is now a bay
where the world in stillness rocks.
**All is visible and all elusive,**
**all is near and can't be touched.**
Paper, book, pencil, glass,
rest in the shade of their names.
Time throbbing in my temples repeats
the same unchanging syllable of blood.
The light turns the indifferent wall
into a ghostly theater of reflections.
**I find myself in the middle of an eye,**
**watching myself in its blank stare.**
**The [moment](/wiki/Moment "Moment") scatters. Motionless,\
I stay and go: I am a pause.**

-   **I am a man: little do I last**

**and the night is enormous.**
But I look up:
the stars write.
Unknowing I understand:
**I too am written,**
**and at this very moment**
**someone spells me out.**

"*Visión del escribiente*" as translated by Eliot Weinberger in *Eagle
Or Sun?* (1976)
-   And to fill all these white pages that are left for me with the same
    monotonous question: **at what hour do the hours
    [end](/wiki/End "End")?**

<!-- -->

-   **I too await the coming of my hour, I too exist. No. I quit.**\
    Yes, I know, I could settle down in an
    [idea](/wiki/Idea "Idea"){.mw-redirect}, in a
    [custom](/wiki/Custom "Custom"){.mw-redirect}, in an obsession. Or
    stretch out on the coals of a [pain](/wiki/Pain "Pain") or some
    [hope](/wiki/Hope "Hope") and wait there, not making much noise. Of
    course it's not so bad: I eat, drink, sleep, make love, observe the
    marked holidays and go to the beach in summer. **People like me and
    I like them.** I take my condition lightly: sickness, insomnia,
    nightmares, social gatherings, the idea of death, the little worm
    that burrows into the heart or the liver (the little worm that
    leaves its eggs in the brain and at night pierces the deepest
    sleep), the future at the expense of today – the today that never
    comes on time, that always loses its bets. **No. I renounce my
    ration card, my I.D., my birth certificate, voter's registration,
    passport, code number, countersign, credentials, safe conduct pass,
    insignia, tattoo, brand.**

<!-- -->

-   **The world stretches out before me, the vast world of the big, the
    little, and the medium.** Universe of kings and presidents and
    jailors, of mandarins and pariahs and liberators and liberated, of
    judges and witnesses and the condemned: stars of the first, second,
    third and nth magnitudes, planets, comets, bodies errant and
    eccentric or routine and domesticated by the laws of gravity, the
    subtle laws of falling, all keeping step, all turning slowly or
    rapidly around a void. **Where they claim the central sun lies, the
    solar being, the hot beam made out of every human gaze, there is
    nothing but a hole and less than a hole: the eye of a dead fish, the
    giddy cavity of the eye that falls into itself and looks at itself
    without seeing. There is nothing with which to fill the hollow
    center of the whirlwind.** The springs are smashed, the foundations
    collapsed, the visible or invisible bonds that joined one star to
    another, one body to another, one man to another, are nothing but a
    tangle of wires and thorns, a jungle of claws and teeth that twist
    us and chew us and spit us out and chew us again. **No one hangs
    himself by the rope of a physical law. The equations fall tirelessly
    into themselves.**\
    **And in regard to the present matter, if the present matters: I do
    not belong to the masters. I don't wash my hands of it, but I am not
    a judge, nor a witness for the prosecution, nor an executioner. I do
    not torture, interrogate, or suffer interrogation.** I do not loudly
    plead for leniency, nor wish to save myself or anyone else. And for
    all that I don't do and for all that they do to us, I neither ask
    forgiveness nor forgive. **Their piety is as abject as their
    justice. Am I innocent? I'm guilty. Am I guilty? I'm innocent. (I'm
    innocent when I'm guilty, guilty when I'm innocent. I'm guilty when
    … but that is another song. Another song? It's all the same song.)
    Guilty innocent, innocent guilty, the fact is I quit.**

<!-- -->

-   **I remember my loves, my conversation, my friendships. I remember
    it all, see it all, see them all.** With melancholy, but without
    nostalgia. And above all, without hope. I know that it is immortal,
    and that, if we are anything, we are the hope of something. For me,
    expectation has spent itself. I quit the nevertheless, the even, the
    in spite of everything, the moratoriums, the excuses and forgiving.
    **I know the mechanism of the trap of morality and the drowsiness of
    certain words. I have lost faith in all those constructions of
    stone, ideas, ciphers. I quit. I no longer defend this broken tower.
    And, in silence, I await the event.**

<!-- -->

-   The first [deaths](/wiki/Deaths "Deaths"){.mw-redirect} will barely
    swell the daily count, and no one in the statistics bureau will
    notice that extra zero. But after a while everyone will begin to
    look at each other and ask: what's happening? Because for months
    doors and windows are going to rattle, furniture and trees will
    creak.

<!-- -->

-   **No use going out or staying at home. No use erecting walls against
    the impalpable.** A mouth will extinguish all the fires, a doubt
    will root up all the decisions. It will be everywhere without being
    anywhere. It will blur all the. mirrors. Penetrating walls and
    convictions, vestments and well-tempered souls, it will install
    itself in the marrow of everyone. Whistling between body and body,
    crouching between soul and soul. And all the wounds will open
    because, with expert and delicate, although somewhat cold, hands, it
    will irritate sores and pimples, will burst pustules and swellings
    and dig into the old, badly healed wounds. **Oh fountain of blood,
    forever inexhaustible! Life will be a knife, a gray and agile and
    cutting and exact and arbitrary blade that falls and slashes and
    divides. To crack, to claw, to quarter, the verbs that move with
    giant steps against us!**\
    **It is not the [sword](/wiki/Sword "Sword") that shines in the
    confusion of what will be. It is not the saber, but
    [fear](/wiki/Fear "Fear") and the whip. I speak of what is already
    among us.** Everywhere there are trembling and whispers,
    insinuations and murmurs. Everywhere the light wind blows, the
    breeze that provokes the immense Whiplash each time it unwinds in
    the air. **Already many carry the purple insignia in their flesh.
    The light wind rises from the meadows of the past, and hurries
    closer to our time.**

-   **[Solitude](/wiki/Solitude "Solitude") is the profoundest
    [fact](/wiki/Fact "Fact") of the

    only being who knows he is alone, and the only one who seeks out
    another.** His [nature](/wiki/Nature "Nature") – if that word can be
    used in reference to man, who has 'invented' himself by saying 'no'
    to nature – consists in his longing to realize himself in another.
    Man is nostalgia and a search for communion. Therefore, when he is
    aware of himself he is aware of his lack of another, that is, of his
    solitude.

-   **willow of crystal, a poplar of water,\
    a pillar of fountain by the wind drawn over,\
    tree that is firmly rooted and that dances,\
    turning course of a river that goes curving,\
    advances and retreats, goes roundabout,\

**the calm course of a star**
or the spring, appearing without urgency**,\
water behind a stillness of closed eyelids\
flowing all night and pouring out prophecies,\
a single presence in the procession of waves\
wave over wave until all is overlapped,\
in a green sovereignty without decline\
a bright hallucination of many wings\
when they all open at the height of the sky,**
**course of a journey among the densities\
of the days of the future and the fateful\
brilliance of misery shining like a bird\
that petrifies the forest with its singing\
and the annunciations of happiness\
among the branches which go disappearing,\
** hours of light even now pecked away by the birds,\
omens which even now fly out of my hand,

an actual presence like a burst of singing**,\
like the song of the wind in a burning building,\
a long look holding the whole world suspended,\
the world with all its seas and all its mountains,\
body of light as it is filtered through agate,\
the thighs of light, the belly of light, the bays,\
the solar rock and the cloud-colored body,\
color of day that goes racing and leaping,\
**the hour glitters and assumes its body,\
now the world stands, visible through your body,\
and is transparent through your transparency,****

-   I travel through your waist as through a river,\
    I voyage your body as through a grove going,\
    as by a footpath going up a mountain\
    and suddenly coming upon a steep ravine\
    I go the straitened way of your keen thoughts\
    break through to daylight upon your white forehead\
    and there my spirit flings itself down, is shattered\
    now I collect my fragments one by one\
    and go on, bodiless, searching, in the dark….

    **you take on the likeness of a tree, a cloud,\

-   **The best thing to do will be to choose the path to
    [Galta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galtaji "w:Galtaji"){.extiw},
    traverse it again (invent it as I traverse it), and without
    realizing it, almost imperceptibly, go to the [end](/wiki/End "End")
    — without being concerned about what “going to the end” means or
    what I meant when I wrote that phrase.** At the very beginning of
    the journey, already far off the main highway, as I walked along the
    path that leads to
    [Galta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galtaji "w:Galtaji"){.extiw},
    past the little grove of banyan trees and the pools of foul stagnant
    water, through the Gateway fallen into ruins and into the main
    courtyard bordered by dilapidated houses, I also had no idea where I
    was going, and was not concerned about it. I wasn’t asking myself
    questions: I was walking, merely walking, with no fixed itinerary in
    mind. I was simply setting forth to meet … what? I didn’t know at
    the time, and I still don’t know. Perhaps that is why I wrote “going
    to the end”: in order to find out, in order to discover what there
    is after the end. **A verbal trap; after the end there is nothing,
    since if there were something, the end would not be the end.
    Nonetheless, we are always setting forth to meet … even though we
    know that there is nothing, or no one, awaiting us.** We go along,
    without a fixed itinerary, yet at the same time with an end (what
    end?) in mind, and with the aim of reaching the end. A search for
    the end, a dread of the end: the obverse and the reverse of the same
    act. **Without this end that constantly eludes us we would not
    journey forth, nor would there be any paths. But the end is the
    refutation and the condemnation of the path: at the end the path
    dissolves, the meeting fades away to nothingness. And the end — it
    too fades away to nothingness.**

    attribute our own sensations and passions to them. Can it also be
    improper to see in them a guide, a way of life?** To learn the art

    learn to remain still and to be as transparent as this fixed light
    amid the frantic branches — this may be a program for life.

-   **Fixity is always
    [momentary](/wiki/Momentary "Momentary"){.mw-redirect}.** It is an
    equilibrium, at once precarious and perfect, that lasts the space of
    an instant: a flickering of the light, the appearance of a cloud, or
    a slight change in temperature is enough to break the repose-pact
    and unleash the series of metamorphoses. Each metamorphosis, in
    turn, is another moment of fixity succeeded by another change and
    another unexpected equilibrium. **No one is alone, and each change
    here brings about another change there. No one is alone and nothing
    is solid: change is comprised of fixities that are momentary
    accords.**

-   Ought I to say that the form of change is fixity, or more precisely,
    that **change is an endless search for fixity**? A nostalgia for
    inertia: indolence and its frozen paradises.
    **[Wisdom](/wiki/Wisdom "Wisdom") lies neither in fixity nor in
    [change](/wiki/Change "Change"), but in the
    [dialectic](/wiki/Dialectic "Dialectic") between the two. A constant
    coming and going: wisdom lies in the
    [momentary](/wiki/Momentary "Momentary"){.mw-redirect}.** It is

-   **Fixity is always momentary. But how can it *always* be so? If it
    were, it would not be momentary — or would not be fixity.** What did
    I mean by that phrase? I probably had in mind the opposition between
    motion and motionlessness, an opposition that the adverb *always*
    designates as continual and universal: it embraces all of time and
    applies to every circumstance. My phrase tends to dissolve this
    opposition and hence represents a sly violation of the principle of
    identity. I say “sly” because I chose the word *momentary* as an
    adjectival qualifier of *fixity* in order to tone down the violence
    of the contrast between movement and motionlessness. A little
    rhetorical trick intended to give an air of plausibility to my
    violation of the rules of logic. **The relations between rhetoric
    and ethics are disturbing: the ease with which
    [language](/wiki/Language "Language") can be twisted is worrisome,
    and the fact that our minds accept these perverse games so docilely
    is no less cause for concern.** *We* ought to subject language to a
    diet of bread and water if we wish to keep it from being corrupted
    and from corrupting us. (The trouble is that
    a-diet-of-bread-and-water is a figurative expression, as is
    the-corruption-of-language-and-its-contagions.) It is necessary to
    unweave (another metaphor) even the simplest phrases in order to
    determine what it is that they contain (more figurative expressions)
    and what they are made of and how (what is language made of? and
    most important of all, is it already made, or is it something that
    is perpetually in the making?). **Unweave the verbal fabric: reality
    will appear.** (Two metaphors.) Can reality be the reverse of the
    fabric, the reverse of metaphor — that which is on the other side of
    language? (Language has no reverse, no opposite faces, no right or
    wrong side.) Perhaps reality too is a metaphor (of what and/or of
    whom?). Perhaps things are not things but words: metaphors, words
    for other things. With whom and of what do word-things speak? (This
    page is a sack of word-things.) **It may be that, like things which
    speak to themselves in their language of things, language does not
    speak of things or of the world: it may speak only of itself and to
    itself.**
    -   Ch. 4

-   **Since movement is a metaphor for *change*, the best thing will be
    to say: nonchange is (always) change. It would appear that I have
    finally arrived at the desired disequilibrium.** Nonetheless, change
    is not the primordial, original word that I am searching for: it is
    a form of *becoming*. When *becoming* is substituted for *change*,
    the relation between the two terms is altered, so that I am obliged
    to replace nonchange by *permanence*, which is a metaphor for
    *fixity*, as *becoming* is for *coming-to-be*, which in turn is a
    metaphor for *[time](/wiki/Time "Time")* in
    [all](/wiki/All "All"){.mw-redirect} its ceaseless transformations….
    **There is no beginning, no original word: each one is a metaphor
    for another word which is a metaphor for yet another, and so on. All
    of them are translations of translations. A transparency in which
    the obverse is the reverse: fixity is always momentary.**\
    **I begin all over again: if it does not make sense to say that
    fixity is *always* momentary, the same may not be true if I say that
    it *never* is.**

-   **My phrase is a moment, the moment of fixity in the monologue of
    [Zeno the Eleatic](/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea "Zeno of Elea") and [Huí
    Shih](/wiki/Hui_Shi "Hui Shi") (“I leave today for Yüeh and I arrive
    yesterday”).** In this monologue one of the terms finally devours
    the other: either motionlessness is merely a state of movement (as
    in my phrase), or else movement is only an illusion of
    motionlessness (as among the
    [Hindus](/wiki/Hindus "Hindus"){.mw-redirect}). Therefore we ought
    not to say either *always* or *never*, but almost always or almost
    never, merely from time to time or more than is generally supposed
    and less than this expression might indicate, frequently or seldom,
    consistently or occasionally, we don’t have at our disposal
    sufficient data to state with certainty whether it is periodic or
    irregular: fixity (always, never, almost always, almost never, etc.)
    is momentary (always, never, almost always, almost never, etc.)
    fixity (always, never, almost always, almost never, etc.) is
    momentary (always, never, almost always, almost never, etc.)
    fixity…. **All this means that fixity never is entirely fixity and
    that it is always a moment of change. Fixity is always momentary.**

    calligraphy and vegetation, a grove of trees and writing, reading
    and a path. **Following a path: reading a stretch of ground,
    deciphering a fragment of world.** Reading considered as a path
    toward…. The path as a reading: an interpretation of the natural
    world? He closes his eyes once more and sees himself, in another
    age, writing (on a piece of paper or on a rock, with a pen or with a
    chisel?) the act in the Mahanātaka describing his visit to the grove
    of the palace of Rāvana. He compares its rhetoric to a page of
    indecipherable calligraphy and thinks: **the difference between
    human writing and divine consists in the fact that the number of
    signs of the former is limited, whereas that of the latter is
    infinite; hence the universe is a meaningless text, one which even
    the gods find illegible.** The critique of the universe (and that of
    the gods) is called grammar…. Disturbed by this strange thought,
    Hanumān leaps down from the wall, remains for a moment in a
    squatting position, then stands erect, scrutinizes the four points
    of the compass, and resolutely makes his way into the thicket.

    which the moment they are formulated are immediately destroyed by
    the merest flickers of light or shadow which are nothing more than

    that I am writing on this paper and that disappears as I read
    them:**\
    they are not the sensations, the perceptions, the mental images, and
    the thoughts which flare up and die away here, now, as I write or as
    I read what I write: they are not what I see or what I have seen,
    they are the reverse of what is seen and of the power of sight—but
    they are not the invisible: they are the unsaid residuum;\
    they are not the other side of reality but, rather, the other side
    of language, what we have on the tip of our tongue that vanishes
    before it is said, the other side that cannot be named because it is
    the opposite of a name:\
    what is not said is not this or that which we leave unsaid, nor is
    it neither-this-nor-that: it is not the tree that I say I see but
    the sensation that I feel on sensing that I see it at the moment
    when I am just about to say that I see it, an insubstantial but real
    conjunction of vibrations and sounds and meanings that on being
    combined suggest the configuration of a
    green-bronze-black-woody-leafy-sonorous-silent presence;\
    no, it is not that either, if it is not a name it surely cannot be
    the description of a name or the description of the sensation of the
    name or the name of the sensation:\
    a tree is not the name tree, nor is it the sensation of tree: it is
    the sensation of a perception of tree that dies away at the very
    moment of the perception of the sensation of tree;\
    names, as we already know, are empty, but what we did not know, or
    if we did know, had forgotten, is that sensations are perceptions of
    sensations that die away, sensations that vanish on becoming
    perceptions, since if they were not perceptions, how would we know
    that they are sensations?;\
    sensations that are not perceptions are not sensations, perceptions
    that are not names—what are they?\
    if you didn’t know it before, you know now: everything is empty;\
    and the moment I say everything-is-empty, I am aware that I am
    falling into a trap: if everything is empty, this
    everything-is-empty is empty too;\
    no, it is full, full to overflowing, everything-is-empty is replete
    with itself, what we touch and see and taste and smell and think,
    the realities that we invent and the realities that touch us, look
    at us, hear us, and invent us, everything that we weave and unweave
    and everything that weaves and unweaves us, momentary appearances
    and disappearances, each one different and unique, is always the
    same full reality, always the same fabric that is woven as it is
    unwoven: even total emptiness and utter privation are plenitude
    (perhaps they are the apogee, the acme, the consummation and the
    calm of plenitude), everything is full to the brim, everything is
    real, all these invented realities and all these very real
    inventions are full of themselves, each and every one of them,
    replete with their own reality;\
    and the moment I say this, they empty themselves: things empty
    themselves and names fill themselves, they are no longer empty,
    names are plethoras, they are donors, they are full to bursting with
    blood, milk, semen, sap, they are swollen with minutes, hours,
    centuries, pregnant with meanings and significations and signals,
    **they are the secret signs that time makes to itself, names suck
    the marrow from things, things die on this page but names increase
    and multiply, things die in order that names may live:**

    evaporate, they are air, they are a sound encased in another sound
    and in another and another, a murmur, a faint cascade of meanings
    that fade away to nothingness:\
    the tree that I say is not the tree that I see, tree does not say

    solid in the universe, in the entire dictionary there is not a
    single word on which to rest our heads, everything is a continual
    coming and going from things to names to things,\
    no, I say that I perpetually come and go but I haven’t moved, as the
    tree has not moved since I began to write,\
    inexact expressions once again: I began, I write, who is writing
    what I am reading?, the question is reversible: what am I reading
    when I write: who is writing what I am reading?**
    -   Ch. 9

<!-- -->

-   the phrases that I write on this paper are sensations, perceptions,
    images, etcetera, which flare up and die down here, in front of my
    eyes, the verbal residuum:\
    the only thing that remains of the felt, imagined, thought,
    perceived, and vanished realities, the only reality that these
    evaporated realities leave behind, a reality that, even though it is
    merely a combination of signs, is no less real than they are:\
    the signs are not presences but they configure another presence, the
    phrases fall into line one after the other on the page and as they
    advance they open up a path toward a temporarily final end,\
    **the phrases configure a presence that disappears, they are the
    configuration of the abolition of presence,\
    yes, it is as though all these presences woven by the configurations
    of the signs were seeking its abolition in order that there might
    appear those inaccessible trees, immersed in themselves, not said,
    that are beyond the end of this phrase,\
    on the other side, there where eyes read what I am writing, and on
    reading it, dissipate it**
