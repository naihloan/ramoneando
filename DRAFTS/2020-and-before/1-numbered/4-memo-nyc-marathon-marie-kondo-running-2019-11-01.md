In a cluttered world of boutique fitness studios and high-end gear,
Guillermo Piñeda Morales reminds us that we don't actually need much to
be our best.

Featuring Guillermo Piñeda Morales

Memo is a minimalist, so we'll keep this short. In the Video Op-Ed
above, we trail Guillermo Piñeda Morales, a.k.a. Memo. He clocked a
2:28:42 at this year's Boston Marathon. At age 46, that places him in
the top 10 marathon runners for his age group globally. That's very
fast.

The American fitness industry is worth \$30 billion, but Memo's not in
on the trend. He won't pop up in your Instagram \#fitspo feed and you
won't get a glimpse of him at your gym. But if you have a resolution to
run a marathon sometime, Memo will likely be whizzing past you. This
Sunday, he'll be running the New York City Marathon, bib \#477. You can
track him on the marathon's [official
app](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/mobile-app). Share
your photos, signs and well wishes using \#WatchMemoRun on social media.

What's Memo's trick? Well, you can find that in the video. But it's far
simpler and cheaper than anything else out there.
