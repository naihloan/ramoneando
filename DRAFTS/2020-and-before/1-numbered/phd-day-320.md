-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why does one blog? I dislike that phrase–“blog”–instead preferring the
more traditional verb “write”. My main motive here is primarily because
a blog seems to be a nifty, adaptable, individualizable format for
recording all of the running that I (typically, when not injured) do.
For years and years (since April 12th, 1995, to be exact) I have kept my
running log in a very standard lined-notebook format. Then, a few years
ago, I joined an online training log so that all of us members of the
Colorado College cross country team could follow along on one another’s
running–ostensibly deriving inspiration and motivation from each other’s
daily and weekly numbers. However, because I am prone to writing a lot
and because my daily or twice-daily runs are much more than just
calorie-burning endeavors for me, I found myself recounting the run but
always editing my training log posts for length because I would
unfailingly go off on some barely-related tangent that I’d been thinking
about while running and the training log almost turned into more of a
daily life journal than just a pure running log.

So, the first-order answer to “why blog?” is that it provides an arena
into which I can write whatever I want, running-related or not. However,
I intend to keep the contents of it primarily running-related/inspired.
This blog will mostly serve as a detailed record of my running.

BUT, why not just do that in a private Word document? This is where
things get prickly, but I think most people aren’t being true to
themselves if they don’t agree at least a little bit with what I’m going
to write next. There is no reason to post one’s life on the internet
(especially in such an interactive format as a blog) other than to feel
as if you have some sort of agency as a human being. That is, that your
actions–and posts–are meaningful to someone other than oneself and that
they affect other humans in some way: to inflame, inspire, degrade,
invoke joy, etc., etc. That is the only–yet incredibly
crucial–difference between maintaining a meticulous personal Word
document on one’s hard drive and posting to a public blog of one’s own
creation. The internet allows others to see you–provides an audience–and
this helps tremendously to validate one’s existence.

But, why or how would someone like myself–who mostly believes that life
is inherently meaningless, absurd–be swayed by such a notion? Because, I
guess, I also believe in the freedom that we have to create meaning in
our lives and that that is not a futile quest–in fact, it’s very
worthwhile–and that identifying with and relating to other like-minded
(or not) humans is a key part of doing that. That’s about as
philosophical as I hope to get today.

Finally, as one might have noticed if he or she were to make it this
far, I like to write. And, as romantically attached to the tradition of
writing with a pencil and paper as I would really like to be, I’m just
not. Wendell Berry and my own father notwithstanding (two people I
greatly admire), I really like the speed and efficiency of writing and
revising with a keyboard and simple word-processing software. My mind
simply operates much quicker than my clumsy cursive-wielding fingers and
wrist will allow, but with a keyboard, my hands can keep up. However, I
will certainly allow that a pencil and paper is still highly appropriate
in some contexts–love letters come to mind. And, in the end, despite
this nascent training blog, I still plan on keeping up my pen and paper
version of a running log (albeit, in a simpler, more bleak format), just
as I have for the past 12 years.

Over the years I’ve had many failed attempts at keeping a daily journal
(beyond a running log), and I hope that this format will keep me
motivated to record my daily life if only for posterity and my own
future enjoyment of what will soon be past events. I don’t pretend to
believe that anyone other than myself really cares about what I will be
putting in here (well, maybe some members of the niche ultrarunning
community and my immediate family and friends), but obviously I’m
leaving that possibility open.

In the end, I’ll write about whatever the hell I want, but this should
primarily be a record of my running and thoughts pertaining to. However,
it’s my blog and I’ll do what I want.
