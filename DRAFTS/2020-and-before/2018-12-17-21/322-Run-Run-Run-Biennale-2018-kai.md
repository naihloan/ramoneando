Dear Friends, 

Please join the RUN! RUN! RUN! Biennale 2018 in exile: Dangerous Movements this Thursday 8 November 2018 CET 18:30-2000. The venue is University of Kent Paris School of Culture and Arts, Reid Hall, 75006, Paris, France. You can follow actions ‘live’ on Twitter CET 18:30-20:00: #r3fest #runrunrunart  #runningstudies. For more details visit the website: www.kaisyngtan.com/r3fest  

Set against our precarious situation today (Brexit, closed borders, the anthropocene et al), and with special attention paid to the Parisien mise-en-scène, the RUN! RUN! RUN! Biennale #r3fest 2018 in exile explores 'Dangerous Movements'. What do mobilities and the (end to the?) freedom of movement mean today? What insights can art movements like Situationism and the historical boundary-crossing foot messenger reveal? In what ways could ‘Running Studies’ contribute towards creative steps to re-make the world around us? (Are we as artists, researchers and runners playing too safe?)  #r3fest 2018 is co-curated by artist Dr Kai Syng Tan (NCCPE 2018 Images Award, ASEAN Para Games Ceremonies 2015) who is based in King’s College London, with author Dr Vybarr Cregan-Reid (Primate Change 2018, Footnotes 2016), who is a Reader in English & Environmental Humanities in the School of English at the University of Kent. This year's programme consists of readings, performance-lectures, poster display, art exhibition and two new performances. #r3fest 2018 features 7 artists, writers and researchers, including friends new to #r3fest Dr Elisa Hererra Altamirano and Zejun Yao, as well as friends who have been with us when RUN! RUN! RUN! began in 2014, like Dr Carali McCall, De Veronique Chance, James Steventon and Dr Matti Tainio. Also showcased is Holland's top writer Abdelkader Benali, whose interview with Kai in 2012 will be shared in her new performance-lecture. Vybarr will read from his newly-published Primate Change (2018), which follows hot on the heels of his bestselling Footnotes (2016). 

The University of Kent’s Paris School of Arts and Culture is a specialist postgraduate centre in one of the most culturally rich cities in the world. We offer advanced, flexible degrees across the arts, including in architecture, history of art, film, drama and literature, with modules that capitalise on the city's vast heritage and culture. RUN! RUN! RUN! Biennale #r3fest is a bi-annual interdisciplinary programme exploring running as an arts and humanities discourse. Founded in 2014 by Kai and UCL geographer Assistant Professor Alan Latham in 2014, it is characterised by ‘productive antagonisms’ (Latham and Tan 2017) in its activation of running as a methodology and metaphor to disrupt + make new connections across disciplinary and other borders (Tan 2018) , as well as its ‘positive atmosphere’ (Guardian 2014). If the first (attended by 50 artists and researchers from 30 institutions at the Slade Research Centre) was a celebratory survey, the second, held in 2016 and co-curated with artists Dr Carali McCall and Annie Grove-White in London, Cardiff and Leeds including in an indoor stadium, was its second, darker album, a sobering insight into borders, gender, ageing, power and the body, set against the backdrop of the sudden, shocking turn of events over Summer 2016.
