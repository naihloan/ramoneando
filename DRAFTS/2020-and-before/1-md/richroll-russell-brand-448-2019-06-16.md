Russell Brand

Every podcaster has their dream list --- guests they fantasize
interviewing. From day one, today's guest has occupied my top slot.

Officially**, Russell Brand **is one of the most recognizable and
best-loved comedy performers in the world. He is also is also a
phenomenally successful author, broadcaster, actor, columnist, political
commentator and mental health & drug rehabilitation activist. His global
bestselling books
include [*Revolution\*,*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101882913/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1101882913&linkId=d2e054a47dcce3aa0f9750f814454f0e)*
*[*Recovery: Freedom from Our
Addictions\*,*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250141923/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1250141923&linkId=eff02bf1d2c3548301f13489e634d70a)* *and
his latest release, [*Mentors: How to Help and Be
Helped\*.*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250226279/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1250226279&linkId=3806d9e20074e7781207f2d51afe5f1d)* *Now
a devoted dad and husband, when he isn't touring or performing he can be
found hosting [*Under The Skin*](https://www.russellbrand.com/podcasts/)
on
[Luminary](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/russell-brand-395/under-the-skin-with-russell-brand-luminary-exclusive/d55de7eb-6f34-48e6-aee4-48703f8fb675),
one of my very favorite podcasts.

Unofficially, Russell is iconic for his very public awakening. A
recovering heroin addict, his struggles with drugs, sex, fame, money and
power were custom tailored for tabloid fodder. And his satirical but
always probing takes on politics, celebrity culture and religion often
find him in the crosshairs of controversy.

![](Pictures/3.jpg){width="9.47917in" height="5.33333in"}

I think of Russell as a hyper-intelligent master of modern discourse and
disputation. Perpetually armed with a most delicious turn-of-phrase, he
is a philosopher of the extreme. A man who has voyaged to the brink of
overindulgence, he has returned to share the unique personal wisdom
gleaned from such surfeit with razor-sharp musings on the broader
humanity we collectively share --- and have a laugh along the path.

With a sui generis brew of eccentric wit, subversive candor and extreme
charm, Russell grapples fearlessly and out loud with that which lays
beneath the surface. With the ideas that define our time. Of the history
we are told. And the ulterior truth behind our constructed reality.

*What is truly real? How can we craft a more fair and just society for
all? How can we live a more intentional life of meaning? What does it
mean be a spiritual being in a human existence?*

Today we voyage beyond the walls of our constructed material world. We
dive into T*he Matrix.* And to coin Russell's phrase, *lick the walls of
the hologram.*

I'm absolutely delighted by this magical, modern-day mystic.

Once a dream, this conversation is now a tangible reality. *Or is it?*

Either way, I sincerely hope you relish the conversation as much as I
adored having it.
