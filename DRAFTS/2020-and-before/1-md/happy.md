# [Happy](https://sivers.org/book/Happy) - by Derren Brown
A snappy, self-assured “Ignore the h8ers” can be a dangerous folly.
By removing or ignoring the sources of honest feedback, you create a downward spiral of self-deception.

Life is chess.
Your plan is affected by the inclinations of the other player.
You must modify your plan constantly.

You know that after you snack you will be hungry again soon.
But this thought does not trouble you.
It is part of an endless chain of desires: you will eat, then, after a while, desire to eat again.
The problem is when you fail to see the same process in your less essential desires.

###### Your desires would diminish drastically if you didn’t need to impress anyone. The things you desire really do little other than fuel further desires and teach you what greed is.
Envy comes from proximity, not disproportion.
###### Your cognitions, perceptions, attitudes and conceptions of yourself are all tied in with those to whom you liken or contrast yourself.

The places and things that insist most loudly that they will make you happy rarely do.
Joy prefers to arrive quietly and alone elsewhere, unceremoniously and unannounced.
Meanwhile, you search for happiness in distractions.

###### Your philosophy can be highly flexible and subject to great changes, but the important point is to have one. It does not need to be easily describable in its entirety, or clearly attributable to any philosophical school. It should stand up to scrutiny and enquiry, being thought through and considered. It must give you a solid foundation without limiting you by insisting on a set of beliefs.

If you don’t identify and engage with your stories, you might quickly find yourself at the mercy of whatever voices happen to be loudest around you.
______

- You don’t make decisions based on your experiences.
- You make them based on the stories of your experiences.
- You should be more concerned with this remembering self.

Pampering the experiencing self is not enough; you want memories too.
Your bestial experiencing self has an attention span of about three seconds.
Its reports are quickly superseded by those of its story-loving, identity-forming superior.

You care a lot about endings when you consider stories.
They tend to define the character of the whole tale.

Your centre of gravity is rooted within yourself.
Work, health, family and friends still make their demands, but you can acknowledge and entertain those forces without feeling them impose directly upon your core self.
Your happiness resides quietly in the epicentre of your emotional life, an area before which you can raise the drawbridge, and from time to time close off from outside threat.

Schopenhauer’s ideal is to be wealthy enough to have expansive free time and the intellectual capabilities to fill it with contemplation and activity in the service of mankind.

Pain and boredom are the two foes of human happiness.
When your stability relies principally on external factors, you shuttle back and forth between the two.

#### Use your intellect to rise above your instincts.

Humans can change themselves.
You can use your reason to change your beliefs.
This will change your emotions, because your emotions follow your beliefs.

Humans can consciously create new habits of thinking, feeling and acting.

If you follow philosophy as a way of life, you can live more flourishing life.

A person living a considered and truly affirmed life would be happy for it to be lived over and over again.

In history, you can find the most effective answers to improving your happiness.

In Greek tragedies, audiences followed a hero trying to impose order (the Apollonian urge) on whatever random fate threw his way (the Dionysian drive).

You should rise above an attraction to beauty in a particular person.
Allow yourself to be drawn to a more general picture of beauty.
And finally to the Idea of beauty itself as an archetype, with little erotic regard for mere mortal examples of it.
In other words: move from sexual attraction to a kind of contemplation.

______

The experiencing self might enjoy a few hours of gaming.
But the remembering self forms a painful story in which you have let yourself down.
##### Your remembering, story-forming self needs a narrative of happiness in the same way your experiencing self requires its pleasures.

Daily irritations are a test that teaches you virtue, and, step by step, moving towards being a better version of yourself.

People take longer-lasting pleasure from being kind to others than having others be kind to them.

There is a deeper happiness to be had in knowing that your life is part of a story of flourishing than there is in merely pursuing entertainment.

______

Epicureanism: indulgence in fine food and drink were rejected because it was seen as eventually causing more pain (hangover, illness, frustrated desire for further luxuries) than the fleeting pleasure they might provide in the moment.

Epicureans lived a simple, ascetic life, believing that by limiting themselves to a few natural desires (such as friendship, bread and water), they would be far happier than those who finally bring pain upon themselves through entertaining greater needs.
Pleasures were rationally chosen, so that they would not ultimately lead to misery.

Happiness is achieved indirectly through individual liberation from the levelling demands of society.

______

Neediness is the destroyer of love.
You can never get enough from people towards whom you feel needy.
If you were sure that you could get by happily enough without this relationship, it’s easier to be less demanding and enjoy what the other person chooses to give.

If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them.
You can wipe out that judgement now.

Feelings are provoked by an exhausting little voice inside your head.
These intermediary thoughts step in and interpret external events as a good reason to feel bad, mad or scared.
You make a judgement about the event and then react to that verdict.

While being tortured on the rack, be able to smile and think “This is happening to my body, but it isn’t happening to me.”

Take responsibility for your emotions, rather than insisting the rest of the world recognise them and respond with perennial sympathy.
