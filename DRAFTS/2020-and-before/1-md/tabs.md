## Readings on wellness and general literature

#### Mark Carrigan | reading lists: [political wellness](https://markcarrigan.net/2015/02/17/things-ive-been-reading-recently-2/)

##### This author I found browsing through The Sociological Review on _[What is graphic social science?](https://www.thesociologicalreview.com/blog/what-is-graphic-social-science.html)_

> _Another brilliant book was The Wellness Syndrome by Carl Cederström and André Spicer. It’s an attack upon biomorality: the social injunction to enjoy, thrive and be healthy (as well as the corresponding shaming of those who fail in this task)._
