How strongly I recommend it: **8**/10\
**(See [my list of 200+ books](/book), for more.)**

Thought I was getting a book about math, but ended up being a
surprisingly good book about learning in general. Main points are about
diffused thinking vs focused thinking.

my notes
--------

Focused mode is used to concentrate on something that’s already tightly
connected in your mind, because you are familiar and comfortable with
the underlying concepts.\

The diffuse approach involves a big-picture perspective. Useful when you
are learning something new. If you are trying to understand or figure
out something new, turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on
your “big picture” diffuse mode.\

As long as we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the
diffuse mode.\

Do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of
the problem.\

A few hours is long enough for the diffuse mode to make significant
progress but not so long that its insights fade away.\
\
When you are first learning new concepts, don't let things go untouched
for longer than a day.\
\
Frustration is usually a good time-out signal.\

\
Once you chunk an idea or concept, you don’t need to remember all the
little underlying details; you’ve got the main idea - the chunk - and
that’s enough.\
\
A key difference between creative scientists and technically competent
but nonimaginative ones is their breadth of interest.\
\
> _Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study helps you strengthen your grasp of the material by viewing it from a different perspective._\
\
Overlearning means a student continues to study or practice immediately
after some criterion has been achieved. Once they understand ‘X,’ they
should move on to something else and return to ‘X’ on another day.\
\
Rather than devote a long session to the study or practice of the same
skill, students should divide their effort across several shorter
sessions.\
\
Two men sat in front of the audience and blithely downed more than
double a deadly dose of arsenic. In tiny doses, arsenic doesn’t seem
harmful. You can even build up an immunity to its effects. This can
allow you to take large doses and look healthy even as the poison is
slowly increasing your risk of cancer and ravaging your organs.
Procrastinators put off just that one little thing. They do it again and
again, gradually growing used to it. They can even look healthy.\
\
The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself.\
\
Learned industriousness helps brighten tasks you once thought were boring.\
\
Use the “Pomodoro”.\
\
If you learn under mild stress, you can handle greater stress much more easily.\
\
By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back
away from judging yourself (Am I getting closer to finishing?) and allow
yourself to relax into the flow of the work.\
\
Work a key problem all the way through. Do another repetition of the
problem. Before you go to sleep, work the problem again. As soon as you
can the next day, work the problem again. You should see that you are
able to solve the problem more quickly now. Your understanding should be
deeper. You may even wonder why you ever had any trouble with it.\

We trick ourselves into doing what we ought to be doing. The
highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best
tricks in their lives. The smart part of us sets up things for us to do
that the not-so-smart part responds to almost automatically,\
