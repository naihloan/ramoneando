The dust came from the truck's open window going through and on our way back one of oh so many gravel trail paths. I could smell the odor at the same time as I could sense the raw dry dirt going through my nostrils and cold throat. So between chocolate-like plants and the wind, the invisible senses are awakened in a way that I did not expect. If anything could have been expected it was the actually amazing Heidi-world tundra grass fields that open to the sky, mountains, forest and snows far beyond. What else? The wind blows loudly enough outside that I get the idea that weather conditions get worse at sunset and I should replenish some fuel.
