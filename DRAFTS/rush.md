Twenty-five drivers start every season in Formula 1, and each year two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers. People who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying. My name is Niki Lauda, and racing people know me for two things. The first is my rivalry with him. I don't know why it became such a big thing. We were just drivers busting each other's balls. To me this is perfectly normal, but other people saw it differently, that whatever it was between us went deeper. The other thing I'm remembered for <i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i> when I was chasing him like an asshole.

<font color="#808080">JAMES :</font> I have a theory why women like racing drivers. It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles. Mostly they think that's pathetic, and they're probably right. It's our closeness to death. You see, the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. The more alive you are. And they can see that in you. They feel that in you. My name is James Hunt. My father is a stockbroker, my sister is a barrister and my brother is an accountant. And I... Well, I do this.

I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

989
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,214
the Nurburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

and dangerous track in the world.

You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

992
01:03:14,092 --> 01:03:17,733
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

993
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:20,463
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

994
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:22,939
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

995
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:26,135
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

Let's get some food.

1517
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:02,016
Good to see you.

1518
01:48:06,092 --> 01:48:08,493
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1519
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:10,860
- Do you fly?
-<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font> No.

1520
01:48:11,252 --> 01:48:12,742
I don't think they'd insure me.

1521
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:14,735
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1522
01:48:14,932 --> 01:48:17,412
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1523
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:20,103
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1524
01:48:20,212 --> 01:48:23,182
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1525
01:48:23,252 --> 01:48:24,856
about the romance of flight.

1526
01:48:25,212 --> 01:48:26,782
No, that's all bullshit.

1527
01:48:27,932 --> 01:48:29,377
So, what brings you here?

1528
01:48:30,532 --> 01:48:33,012
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1529
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:35,936
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur. <font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>

1530
01:48:36,012 --> 01:48:37,298
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1531
01:48:37,332 --> 01:48:38,493
Pre-season testing.

1532
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:40,535
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1533
01:48:40,612 --> 01:48:42,774
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1534
01:48:42,852 --> 01:48:45,139
When do you start testing? Next week?

1535
01:48:45,172 --> 01:48:47,140
No. What, are you nuts?

1536
01:48:47,212 --> 01:48:48,941
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1537
01:48:49,012 --> 01:48:50,457
so I could get right back to work.

1538
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:54,457
Why? You have to.

1539
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:58,140
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1540
01:48:58,212 --> 01:49:01,614
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1541
01:49:03,132 --> 01:49:05,180
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1542
01:49:05,812 --> 01:49:08,895
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1543
01:49:08,972 --> 01:49:11,816
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1544
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:14,054
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1545
01:49:14,132 --> 01:49:16,180
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1546
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,374
- The risks were totally unacceptable.
-<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

1547
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:21,372
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1548
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:23,062
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1549
01:49:23,132 --> 01:49:25,976
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1550
01:49:26,012 --> 01:49:28,982
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1551
01:49:29,092 --> 01:49:30,503
And it felt great.

1552
01:49:31,412 --> 01:49:33,733
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1553
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:37,180
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1554
01:49:37,532 --> 01:49:41,332
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1555

You English, you're such assholes.

1556
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:46,497
You know my position.

1557
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:48,183
Twenty per cent risk.

1558
01:49:48,252 --> 01:49:52,018
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1559
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:54,703
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1560
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:56,776
You kill the sport.

1562
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:03,695
- James!
- Come on!

1563
01:50:06,692 --> 01:50:08,057
I've got to go.

1564
01:50:09,572 --> 01:50:11,540
Careful in this thing.

1565
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,062
James.

1566
01:50:19,292 --> 01:50:23,058
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1567
01:50:23,372 --> 01:50:26,296
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1568
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:29,295
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1569
01:50:29,892 --> 01:50:32,657
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1570
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:34,939
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1571
01:50:35,492 --> 01:50:37,574
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1572
01:50:37,652 --> 01:50:39,939
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?

1573
01:50:40,052 --> 01:50:43,738
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life.

1574
01:50:43,812 --> 01:50:45,974
"It can be a blessing, too.

1575
01:50:46,052 --> 01:50:48,817
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1576
01:50:49,452 --> 01:50:51,739
And you know what? He was right.

1577
01:50:54,332 --> 01:50:58,098
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1578
01:50:58,132 --> 01:50:59,941
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1579
01:50:59,972 --> 01:51:01,815
-<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>
- Disowned by our families.

1580
01:51:01,932 --> 01:51:03,297
Headed nowhere.

1581
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:06,699
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1582
01:51:06,772 --> 01:51:08,183
It was not bad, huh?

1583
01:51:09,252 --> 01:51:11,175
No, it's not bad.

1584
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:14,813
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1585
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:18,017
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1586
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:20,820
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1587
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:23,493
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1588
01:51:23,612 --> 01:51:26,934
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1589
01:51:27,012 --> 01:51:29,174
if you don't have any fun?

1590
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:31,701

1593
01:51:41,292 --> 01:51:42,703
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1594
01:51:44,452 --> 01:51:46,614
You will...champ.

1595
01:51:49,132 --> 01:51:50,896
You look good, Niki.

1596
01:51:51,452 --> 01:51:54,342
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1597
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:03,220
<font color="#808080">NIKI :</font> Of course,
he didn't listen to me.

1598
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:04,737
For James,

1599
01:52:04,812 --> 01:52:06,974
one world title was enough.

1600
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,502
He had proved

1601
01:52:08,532 --> 01:52:11,820
what he needed to prove, to himself

1602
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,179
and anyone who doubted him.

1603
01:52:15,012 --> 01:52:16,901
And two years later he retired.

1604
01:52:17,172 --> 01:52:20,813
When I saw him next in London
seven years later,

1605
01:52:20,932 --> 01:52:23,060
me as champion again,

1606
01:52:23,172 --> 01:52:25,061
him as broadcaster,

1607
01:52:25,132 --> 01:52:29,535
he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.

1608
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:32,496
Still living each day like his last.

1609
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:35,742
When I heard he'd died,

1610
01:52:35,852 --> 01:52:38,219
aged 45, of a heart attack,

1611
01:52:38,332 --> 01:52:39,857
I wasn't surprised.

1612
01:52:40,852 --> 01:52:42,741
I was just sad.

1613
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:45,935
People always think of us as rivals,

1614
01:52:46,012 --> 01:52:49,619
but he was among the very few I liked,

1615
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:53,902
and even fewer that I respected.

1616
01:52:57,052 --> 01:52:59,783
He remains the only person I envied.
