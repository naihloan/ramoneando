### The 50 Most Influential People in Running

[September 1, 2015](https://www.dmsesports.com/press-coverage/the-50-most-influential-people-in-running)

**RUNNER'S WORLD**

### The athletes, execs, inventors, and others who inspire us and enable our modern running lives

The first question we asked ourselves while embarking on this ambitious
endeavor was, What do we even mean by “influential?” After lots of
research, scrutiny, and debate, here’s where we landed: Influence is the
ability to set trends, inspire participation, and drive engagement in
the sport and culture of running.

Definition in hand, we turned to a long list of experts representing a
diverse cross-section of the running world: athletes, race directors,
journalists, running-store owners, grassroots organizers, shoe-company
execs, sport-governance officials—even a “run concierge.” We asked each
to nominate five people, giving close consideration to those from their
corners of the culture who are having an impact today, in 2015. More
than 60 smart, plugged-in leaders weighed in (with many of them being
nominated by peers in the process).

In the end, 168 worthy nominees were put forth, and a team of *Runner’s
World* editors whittled them down to (about) 50, leaning strongly on the
names that experts singled out again and again. [(Read more about the
process
here.)](http://www.runnersworld.com/from-the-editor/who-runs-running)

We organized the finalists into six categories:

-   Champions: The elite athletes who inspire us the most
-   Maestros: The organizers of events that amaze and unite us
-   Gurus: The coaches, journalists, and experts who make us better and smarter
-   Innovators: The business leaders and ideas people who make the industry hum
-   Advocates: The proponents of important causes who give voice to the average runner
-   Visionaries: The brilliant minds who seek answers to the most important questions in running

Now, let the debate begin:

### **CHAMPIONS**

**USAIN BOLT**\
29, Kingston, Jamaica\
Winner of six Olympic golds; owns 100- and 200-meter world records\
Influence: Financial Clout, Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

The “world’s fastest man” is not just the most recognizable runner on
the planet, but one of the most iconic athletes in any sport. Bolt has
pushed the limits of human speed while transcending the doping
skepticism that plagues his sport. What has made Bolt such a crossover
sensation—he’s the only runner on the 2015 Forbes 100 highest paid
athletes list, reeling in \$21 million last year—is his larger-than-life
personality signified by his trademark “To Di World” pose. Well, that
plus his genius marketing awareness: lucrative deals with Puma, Soul
Electronics, and others ensure that even when he slows down on the
track, the Bolt brand will live on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**MO FARAH**\
32, London\
2012 Olympic 5K and 10K gold medalist; winner of five worlds golds and
one silver\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

He’s already an all-time great on the track and has plenty of
competition left in him. Farah, who has recently been dragged into the
doping scandal encircling his Nike Oregon Project coach, Alberto
Salazar, has brought charisma to a sport that is often lacking in
it—he’s gone after the 100-meter sack race world record, and has a
signature move, the “Mobot,” that is somehow both derivative of Usain
Bolt’s more famous pose and still utterly endearing. Put simply: The
running world loves Mo Farah, and he loves it back. He’s inherited the
space once filled by Haile Gebrselassie, and like that Ethiopian legend
who set the marathon world record after a stellar track career, Farah’s
foray into road racing has fans worldwide holding their breath.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SHALENE FLANAGAN**\
34, Portland, Oregon\
Olympic bronze medalist; U.S. 10K record holder; second-fastest American
woman marathoner\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

Flanagan has won the hearts of running fans not for her race
accomplishments—which are numerous—but for her unbridled, never-say-die
spirit. Her gutsy effort in her hometown Boston Marathon the year after
the bombings, when she led for 19 miles and set a PR but ultimately
finished seventh, was a fitting counterpart to Meb Keflezighi’s stunning
win in the men’s race. She’s drawn from that inner fire to be very vocal
about doping in the sport, too. Pair that zeal with the backing of
superbrand Nike and a strong social media presence, and it’s not too
much of a stretch to say that, even after fading to ninth in Boston this
year, Flanagan is the face of elite distance running in America right
now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LAUREN FLESHMAN**\
33, Bend, Oregon\
Two-time U.S. 5K champion; cofounder of Picky Bars; writer\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

Few elite runners have managed the awkward late stages of their pro
career more effectively than Fleshman, who has a sponsorship with
upstart women’s apparel brand Oiselle, her own energy bar company, a
strong social media presence (it won her a 2015 Shorty Award—think
“Oscars for social media”), and no problem poking the bears of the
running world, particularly USA Track & Field. Fleshman, who also has
written a *Runner’s World* column, is everywhere, even when not running.
“She has reached a visibility that extends far beyond her achievements
as a runner,” says writer David Epstein. “Her style,” adds journalist
Dick Patrick, “is personal and revealing, drawing fans, especially
women, to the sport.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**AMELIA BOONE**\
32, Chicago\
Obstacle course racing superstar\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

“You cannot have a conversation about OCR \[obstacle course racing\]
that doesn’t start and end with Amelia,” says Matt Davis, cofounder of
Obstacle Racing Media. OCR is the acronym that Tough Mudders/Spartan
Racers/Warrior Dashers and the like use to describe the still-evolving
space of endurance sport that they occupy.

Boone, a corporate lawyer, has emerged as a bona fide OCR superstar,
winning the 2013 Spartan Race World Championship as well as the 2012 and
2014 World’s Toughest Mudder titles. She has succeeded at everything
from sprint-style obstacle races to 24-hour slogs, exploits that have
earned her a deal with Spartan Race title sponsor Reebok. All this from
a person who discovered OCR by accident, and isn’t fully comfortable
describing herself as a professional athlete—but does self-identify on
Twitter as a “ketchup & Pop-Tarts enthusiast.”

Having conquered the OCR world, Boone is now turning her superstar
smarts and competitive drive to ultrarunning. With exactly two
traditional running events under her belt, a half-marathon and a trail
race, Boone signed up for the Georgia Death Race, a 68-mile gauntlet
with 40,000 feet of elevation change. She ended up placing 31st out of
170 entrants, and third among women. This April she won a 30K trail run
in California and currently ranks as the top female Spartan athlete in
the world. Are OCR and ultrarunning a fit? One thing seems clear: If
anyone can bridge the gap between running disciplines, it’s Boone.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**KARA GOUCHER**\
37, Boulder, Colorado\
Two-time Olympian; 10K world championships bronze medalist; fastest
American woman half-marathoner\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

"Who doesn’t love Kara?” asks Tracey Russell, CEO of the Los Angeles
Marathon. Goucher isn’t just one of the most recognizable runners in
America; she may be the best at cultivating a fan base. In 2013, she
struck out on her own—leaving sponsor Nike (she’d later sign with
Skechers and Oiselle) as well as her coach, Jerry Schumacher, and
training partner, Shalane Flanagan, to return to her college coaches in
Boulder. The move has liberated Goucher, and not only to do fun stuff
like hosting a wine-and-running retreat with fans in Napa last year, and
blogging and tweeting about her training, motherhood, and cooking. In
June, she boldly went on the record as part of an investigative story
where she accused her former coach Alberto Salazar of impropriety.
Goucher feels free, and that makes her as important to the sport as
she’s ever been.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ELLIE GREENWOOD**\
36, Vancouver\
and\
**ROB KRAR**\
38, Flagstaff, Arizona\
UltraRunning magazine’s Ultra Runners of the Year\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Runner

Though ultrarunning will likely never fully come into the mainstream,
Greenwood and Krar are the kind of athletes that runners universally
admire: dominant, courageous, and yet disarmingly modest. Greenwood, a
Scotland native, inspired fans with her grit by overcoming a stress
fracture in 2013 to cruise to victories in both South Africa’s iconic
Comrades ultra and the 100K World Championships last year. Her course
records include the grueling Western States 100-miler in California.
Krar has combated his own challenge en route to winning Western States
the past two years and the Leadville Leadville Trail 100-miler in
Colorado last year: depression. He’s produced a short film where he’s
opened up. “He’s gone public with it,” says ultrarunning legend Dean
Karnazes, “and in the process has inspired and given hope to legions of
others dealing with mental health issues.”


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SCOTT JUREK**\
41, Boulder, Colorado\
Ultramarathoner; author\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete, Expert

Jurek had already solidified his résumé as one of the greatest
ultrarunners ever by the time his appearance in Christopher McDougall’s
best seller *Born to Run* made him practically a household name in 2009.
He’s won just about every ultra that matters and reigned at the epic
Western States 100-mile Endurance Run for an astonishing seven straight
years. This summer, Jurek made headlines by setting the Appalachian
Trail thru-hike speed record, traversing the iconic route in 46 days,
eight hours, and seven minutes. Jurek makes this list, however, not only
for his athletic feats but for becoming a vegan icon since the 2012
release of his own *New York Times* best-selling memoir *Eat & Run*. In
telling his personal nutrition journey and sharing some of his own
plant-based recipes, he almost single-handedly made veganism viable for
serious athletes. Through social media, appearances at races, and
continued feats of extreme athleticism, he has carved out an enduring
space for himself in the running world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SANYA RICHARDS-ROSS**\
30, Austin, Texas\
Winner of four Olympic and five world Outdoor gold medals, fastest
400-meter runner in U.S. history\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

“Sanya is well-versed, ambitious, hardworking, and the most genuine
athlete I’ve ever interacted with,” says a man quite familiar with those
traits, U.S. middle- and long-distance great Bernard Lagat.

Like her professed hero, track legend and outspoken civil rights
activist Wilma Rudolph, Richards-Ross has leveraged her visibility to
effect major change. Since the 2012 London Olympics, she has been in the
vanguard protesting the International Olympic Committee’s Rule 40, which
restricts sponsor promotion (and therefore earning) opportunities for
athletes during and around the Games—and in February, the IOC announced
a change that will allow athletes to promote their individual sponsors,
just in time for Rio 2016.

Unlike many athlete dissidents in track and field, where career vitality
relies on often-fickle sponsorships, Richards-Ross has boldly spoken out
while still in her competitive prime. In May, 11 years into her pro
career, she led the women’s distance medley relay team to a world record
and also won gold in the 4 x 400 meter relay team at the IAAF/BTC World
Relays in the Bahamas.

A Nike athlete, Richards-Ross also has her own reality show on WE TV, a
youth empowerment sports clinic, a mobile app, and a large following on
social media. She’s been an active role model for young athletes and
girls, and has also been open about her battles with a rare autoimmune
disease.

Says another respected track vet, Olympian and Louisiana State
University coach Khadevis Robinson: “She is truly an all-around
ambassador for the sport.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**MEB KEFLEZIGHI**\
40, San Diego\
Olympic silver medalist; winner of the 2009 New York City and 2014
Boston marathons\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

If the nominating process for this list had been a competition,
Keflezighi would have won it going away. Though our 60 experts came from
every corner of the sport, at least one in four of them named
Keflezighi. Yes, he’s wowed us with gutsy performances on the grandest
stages, but Keflezighi’s universal appeal only begins with his racing.
Sports industry analyst Matt Powell notes that as a brand ambassador,
his “win at Boston singlehandedly gave Skechers athletic performance
credibility,” and L.A. Marathon CEO Tracey Russell observed that “at the
2015 Boston Marathon Expo, it seemed as though every other booth had a
life-size cutout of Meb.” Few have more directly observed his impact
than Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray, who perhaps best
sums up Keflezighi’s impact: “His character, demeanor, and integrity are
second to none. He has inspired legions of people to take up the sport.”





------------------------------------------------------------------------

**JOAN BENOIT SAMUELSON**\
58, Freeport, Maine\
1984 Olympic Marathon gold medalist; founder of the Beach to Beacon 10K;
Nike consultant\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete

That Samuelson’s competitive ability has outlasted that of her
contemporaries such as Bill Rodgers and Frank Shorter might explain why
they both were so eager to nominate her to this list. “She’s living
proof of a paradigm shift in older women runners,” says Shorter. She ran
a 2:54:03 at this year’s Boston Marathon, which would’ve beaten the
world record for 57-year-olds by 26 seconds except that the downhill
point-to-point course disqualifies it. No matter: She already owns the
age 53 mark and once upon a time set two overall world records of
2:31:23 and 2:26:12. With Samuelson, it’s always been as much about her
grace as a competitor as just how incredibly and consistently fast she’s
been. This fall she plans to run the Chicago Marathon, 30 years after
setting an American record in the Windy City of 2:21:21. Her goal: to
run within 30 minutes of that time.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


### MAESTROS

**ADRIAN BIJANADA**\
36, New York City\
Creator of the Obstacle Course Racing World Championships\
Influence: Strategic Authority, Expert

Part of the challenge for “OCR” outsiders is grasping what falls under
its umbrella: There’s Tough Mudder, Warrior Dash, Spartan Race, and many
other series. What makes Bijanada “a visionary,” according to Matt
Davis, cofounder of Obstacle Racing Media, is that he aspires to bring
all of these together with one singular title event. For the inaugural
OCR worlds held in Cincinnati last October, Bijanada created standards
and identified qualifying events from all over the world, developed a
\$60,000 prize purse, and attracted 700 athletes from 12 countries,
including OCR superstars like Spartan Race’s Jon Albon and World’s
Toughest Mudder’s Junyong Pak. This year he’s tinkering with a global
rankings system in advance of October’s main event. “Adrian has created
an event to unite everyone,” Davis says. “He was scoffed at by most at
first—including me—then pulled it off.”





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**MICHAEL CAPIRASO**\
53, New York City\
NYRR President/CEO\
and\
**PETER CIACCIA**\
62, New York City\
NYRR President, Events/NYC Marathon Director\
Influence: Financial Clout, Strategic Authority

A footnote to Mary Wittenberg’s entry is that it will take two people to
replace her—these guys. By virtue of inheriting her New York Road
Runners empire, Capiraso and Ciaccia are influential. Neither, however,
are newbies: Capiraso has been with NYRR since 2010 and was the
“day-to-day” boss as chief operating officer (not to mention that he has
run the last 23 NYC Marathons), and Ciaccia, a 14-year NYRR veteran, was
responsible for the operations of the NYC Marathon as the race’s
technical director. Wittenberg called him “the person responsible for
growing the marathon into the world’s largest.” The first major test for
the twosome comes on November 1, when the NYC Marathon will be held
without Wittenberg at the helm for the first time in a decade.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**SEB COE**\
58, London\
Orchestrator of the 2012 London Olympics; two-time 1500-meter Olympic
gold medalist; IAAF president\
Influence: Financial Clout, Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete, Strategic
Authority, Expert

Already one of the most powerful people in global track and field, Coe
went up a notch in August when he was elected president of the IAAF,
world road racing and track-and-field’s governing body. The businessman,
ex-member of parliament, and sports legend is still riding high after
not only winning the Olympic bid for London but also for putting on a
great show. *Runner’s World* U.K. editor-in-chief Andy Dixon says Coe,
in his new role, promises to reform the world meets calendar to increase
the importance of big international competitions, youth engagement, and
anti-doping resources. Journalist Roger Robinson calls Coe’s manifesto a
“visionary strategy.” One more fun Coe goal: making cross country a
Winter Olympic sport.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**RICH KENAH**\
45, Atlanta\
Executive director, Atlanta Track Club\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Strategic Authority

The former 800-meter Olympian has been on the job only since February
2014, but he’s made waves in a hurry. The Atlanta Track Club is best
known for hosting the Peachtree Road Race—which drew 60,000 runners this
year, making it the largest 10K race in the world. Kenah uses it as his
playground for big ideas. “He’s going to make a positive impact on other
races and organizations because he isn’t afraid to try new things,” says
Merhawi Keflezighi, who would know: Last year Merhawi worked with Kenah
on a quirk that set his brother, Meb, at the back of the field with the
challenge of passing at least 22,500 runners to raise \$75,000 for an
inaugural ATC youth race. This year, Kenah established a team
competition, the Peachtree Cup, for elites from the U.S. against Africa,
Asia, and Europe, linked to boosted purse prizes. Which has the running
world asking: What will the mad race director think of next?





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**JEAN KNAACK**\
43, Arlington, Virginia\
Executive director, Road Runners Club of America\
Influence: Strategic Authority

Knaack, says former New York Road Runners CEO Allan Steinfeld, “has the
ear of more running clubs and race directors than perhaps anyone.” For
the last decade, she’s been behind the curtain guiding more than 2,400
event directors and club leaders on best practices, big and small, that
have tangible impacts on the experiences of runners across the country.
She helped roadblock notorious race canceler Dean Reinke and others like
him from bilking runners in the future, helped revitalize the RRCA’s
youth running program to the tune of \$115,000 in grants to youth clubs
since 2007, and spearheaded the RunPro Camp, which helps top college
runners transition to professional running careers. “She’s kind of under
the radar,” says Merhawi Keflezighi, agent to his brother Meb and
several other elite Americans, “but her network is so influential.”





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**MARY WITTENBERG**\
53, New York City\
Global CEO, Virgin Sport, former president and CEO of New York Road
Runners\
Influence: Financial Clout, Social Media Savvy, Elite Athlete, Strategic
Authority

Arguably the most influential woman in running now works for Richard
Branson, one of the most unconventional billionaires on the planet. That
in itself is an interesting development for the sport. How Wittenberg
became the fitness consigliere to a man whose other interests include
tourism of outer space also suggests that the best is yet to come.

Starting in 2005, Wittenberg oversaw the growth of NYRR, the world’s
foremost running organization, which puts on the New York City Marathon,
the world’s largest. In her last year alone, she increased the
nonprofit’s income nearly 30 percent to \$87.5 million, which fuels an
enterprise that puts on more than 50 races attended by more than 400,000
people. She grew the field for NYRR’s main event, the marathon, to
50,530 last year, and in 2012 secured a five-year deal with ESPN/ABC to
televise the marathon and other NYRR events. Free youth running
initiatives that she has spearheaded impact more than 200,000 kids a
year.

Once a competitive runner who won the 1987 Marine Corps Marathon,
Wittenberg has been unafraid to take up the mantle on big issues in the
pro sport. A champion for elite athletes, she guided NYRR to be a leader
in prize money. As cofounder of the World Marathon Majors—a partnership
among the world’s six marquee races—she helped lead the charge to
improve anti-doping protocols.

She’s endured her share of criticisms—including for the delayed
cancellation of the 2012 NYC Marathon in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.
It’s telling, however, the extent to which she’s endured the occasional
storm, metaphorical and otherwise, to be so beloved by people from every
corner of the sport: Out of 168 individuals nominated to our list, only
Meb Keflezighi’s name came up more frequently.

Though details on Virgin Sport remain scarce, Wittenberg’s charge is to
launch a lifestyle company focused on “expanding the reach of mass
participatory events in running, cycling, and other formats.” In other
words, it’s a role she’s uniquely suited for—only now, she gets to do it
on a much larger scale.

**VIN LANANNA**\
62, Eugene, Oregon\
President, TrackTown USA; Associate Athletic Director, University of
Oregon; Coach of the men’s track and field team in the 2016 Olympics\
Influence: Strategic Authority, Expert

Few have done more to put the U.S. in the international track-and-field
spotlight. Specifically, Eugene: He’s turned a town with an already rich
running history into a mecca for big events. To the chagrin of some, who
would like to see the wealth shared, Lananna has brought several major
track meets to Oregon, including the 2014 world junior championships in
Eugene and next spring’s world indoor championships in Portland. The
former title-winning track coach’s biggest get came in April when it was
announced that, for the first time, the world outdoor championships
would be held in the U.S. at Hayward Field in 2021. “Vin not only had
the audacity to suggest that a small college town in Oregon could host
the sport’s biggest competition and celebration,” says Atlanta Track
Club’s Rich Kenah, “he had the skills to maneuver a minefield of
international sport politics and pulled it off.” In July, on top of all
of his wheelings and dealings, Lananna was named the U.S. men's track
and field coach for the 2016 Olympics.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





**DAVE MCGILLIVRAY**\
61, North Andover, Massachusetts\
Race director, Boston Marathon; founder and president of DMSE Sports\
Influence: Elite Athlete, Strategic Authority, Expert

One might describe McGillivray as “the race director’s race director.”
In addition to conducting the Boston Marathon since 1988 and a grand
total of more than 1,000 events since 1981 through his company, he might
also be the most accessible man in the industry. “No matter what time of
day or night,” says L.A. Marathon CEO Tracey Russell, “he provides
guidance and shares his wisdom to any race director—regardless of event
size—who reaches out for help.” It seems impossible that any one person
could muster the energy for all those events and phone calls. This,
however, is the same man (and dedicated philanthropist) who, in 1978,
ran 3,452 miles across the country, raising \$150,000 for the Jimmy Fund
in the process. He also runs his age in miles every year on his
birthday—yes, he ran 60 on his 60th. In other words, he’s hardly lost a
step.

### GURUS\
 

**DAVID EPSTEIN**\

Reporter, ProPublica; author of The Sports Gene\
Influence: Social Media Savvy, Expert

In June, Epstein teamed with the BBC to break one of the biggest stories
of the year, documenting the accusations and evidence put forth by
former Nike Oregon Project staff and runners that coach Alberto Salazar
and distance star Galen Rupp violated anti-doping rules. (The two have
denied the allegations.) In the last several years, Epstein has emerged
as the preeminent investigative reporter on performance-enhancing drugs;
while previously at *Sports Illustrated*, he helped break the news that
baseball star Alex Rodriguez tested positive for steroids and also
contributed to the efforts that toppled Lance Armstrong. His 2013 *New
York Times* best-selling book *The Sports Gene* advanced public
discourse over the role of genetics in sports, especially running.
Epstein’s stature has become such that the mere presence of his byline
implies that a story is a big deal.

He’s known as “America’s Coach,” and with good reason. Once one of the
nation’s fastest runners—a 1972 Olympian in the 10K who trained
alongside the likes of Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter, and Bill
Rodgers—he brought the sport to the masses by slowing things down for
beginners. “He is personally responsible for inspiring thousands of

There’s perhaps no clearer testament to the man’s staying power than
this: When you Google “marathon training” or “half marathon training,”
Higdon’s is the first name that you’ll see. “I ran my first marathon 15
years ago,” says Westin Hotel’s national running concierge Chris
Heuisler, “and like nearly every first-time marathoner I meet in my job,
I used his marathon training plan. It is remarkable that no one has
dethroned Mr. Higdon from the top spot.” By Higdon’s own estimation, a
half-million runners have gone 26.2 using his famous plan. A 1952
Olympic Trials qualifier in the 10K, record-setting masters runner,
cofounder of the Road Runners Club of America, social media expert, and
author of 36 books—with more on the way—Higdon has spent a lifetime
working tirelessly to earn the trust of the running public.

but, in retrospect, brilliant sponsorship with breakout shoe brand Hoka
One One in 2014. Hawi who joined with Dave McGillivray and Superhero

runners—particularly those at the front of the pack—have also earned
their stripes as tenacious watchdogs.

The identical twin brothers founded Letsrun.com in 2000 after they moved
to Flagstaff, Arizona, to focus on Weldon’s dream of qualifying for the
Olympics. Sequestered in the high-altitude training haven, they launched
the site, which to this day maintains an endearing early-Internet page
design, to be a meeting place for those obsessed with competitive
running.

Weldon (above left) fell short of his Olympic goal, but the site took
off, boosted by the vibrancy of its “World Famous Message Boards.” The
boards, which allowed for anonymous posting until recently, have been
criticized by some as havens for vitriol and unfounded rumors, but
they’ve also been a breeding ground for major story breaks: the outing
of vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s bogus marathon PR claim
started there, as did the chatter over a civilian photo that would help
identify Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The Johnsons
themselves have been tenacious in their coverage of doping, breaking the
news that former U.S. distance elite Mo Trafeh had purchased EPO.

“Love ’em or hate ’em—and that probably depends on how much time you’ve
spent on the message boards—the more newspaper coverage of running
contracts, the more Letsrun becomes the daily newsfeed for breaking news
and quick results,” says author David Epstein. Indeed, Letsrun.com’s
homepage has become an essential bookmark for followers of the elite
sport.

“He’s probably the most successful coach in America and maybe the most

his star pupil Galen Rupp of violating anti-doping policies (Salazar and
Rupp have refuted the allegations). As a coach, Salazar made his name
shepherding the careers of one of the planet’s best distance runners (Mo
Farah), arguably America’s best 10,000-meter runner (Rupp), and other
accomplished runners, with a reputation for pushing the legal limits of
modern sports medicine. He’s also an avatar of his employer, Nike:
intimidating, aggressive, indomitable. His critics call him a bully and
have long questioned the secrecy and intensity of his training program;
his supporters have praised him for his savvy and passion. He is, after

Seppelt may be the most dangerous man in the sport—if you’re a crooked

with an exposé of rampant doping in Kenya. Late last year he released an
incendiary documentary that accused Russia of widespread systematic
doping—and implicated the IAAF, the governing body for the sport, in
covering it up. Then, in August, he released another documentary
revealing what he reports are blood tests from the IAAF from 2001 to
2012 that show that a third of medals in distance events at the Olympics
and World Championships during that time frame were won by athletes with
“suspicious” bloodwork—results “highly suggestive of doping or at the
very least abnormal,” according to an expert interviewed in the film.
“After so many years of speculation and the isolated suspension here or
there,” says ProPublica reporter David Epstein, “he pulled back the
curtain, and I think launched an investigation that will carry on and
even grow for years.”

The colorful telecom tycoon isn’t just one of running’s biggest fans—he
might be its richest, too. The latest information on his earnings shows
that, in 2013 alone, he raked in \$29 million, and the prolific
tweeter/hot pink shirt–wearer/tech party–crasher/avid runner seems
intent on spreading the love to his favorite sport.

Legere, who at age 53 ran a 2:53 at the 2011 NYC Marathon, appears to be
trying to single-handedly improve earning incentives for top American
runners. Last May, he ponied up \$20,000—including \$5,000 first-place
prizes—to help miler Nick Willis launch the Michigan Track Classic.
Prior to the NYC Half this March, he tweeted a series of
performance-based offers to Meb Keflezighi and other top American men;
Legere ended up donating \$25,000 to Keflezighi’s namesake charity for
leading the race coming out of Central Park. For the BAA 5K in April, he
took to Twitter again to announce bonus awards of \$5,000 each to Ben
True and Molly Huddle for breaking American records. He timed the
announcement of a T-Mobile sponsorship of Keflezighi to just prior to
this year’s Boston Marathon, and also tried (and failed) to offer a
performance bonus to top Americans at the race. Earlier in 2015, he made
a six-figure donation to his alma mater, UMass Amherst, where he ran
competitively. He frequently tweets encouragement and congratulations to
top American runners.

Legere’s long-term strategy with this foray into elite running remains
inscrutable; the casual timing and method for his prize announcements
almost give the impression that he’s making them as the mood strikes.
The amounts are basically Monopoly money to a man of his wealth. Still,
his running résumé and prior involvement on NYRR’s board of directors
reveal a sincere interest in the vitality of elite running. For a sport
always yearning for investment from companies and individuals outside of
running, that’s a wonderful thing.

The former competitive ultrarunner, Ironman and Xterra triathlete, and

runners, especially women. One of Sims’s primary targets: the Gatorades
of the world that she believes overload athletes with carbohydrates to
the detriment of hydration. Her company Osmo Nutrition, which launched
in 2012, intends to correct an industry obsession with crashing.

Sims believes the solution is simple: Separate fueling from hydration,
or as Osmo touts, “food in your pocket, hydration in your bottle.” In
practice, her recommendation is to fuel well in advance of training or
racing—three or four hours—drinking a low-carb hydrating drink (the term
is “low osmolarity”), and being mindful not to misread late-workout
fatigue as a need to fuel up when it might just be dehydration. Sims
spent about 15 years researching the science and used herself, pro
teammates, and elite endurance athletes as guinea pigs. Osmo’s product
line emphasizes in-workout hydration paired with postworkout recovery
protein.

Sims’s other main interest is how women’s fitness needs differ from
men’s. “Women are not small men”—a dig at the overemphasis on male
subjects in exercise physiology studies—has been adopted by Osmo as a
slogan for its women’s line. Her research has found that hormonal
fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can impact athletic performance.
Her recommendation: Consume more protein before and after training, be
mindful of hydration, and ingest more carbs for intense sessions.

lowered risks of cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, and an
array of other ailments, and have also debunked the myth that running
increases osteoarthritis risk. The study, which has received \$4 million
in grants from the National Institutes of Health since it began, is
close to running out of money, and Williams is awaiting word from the
National Institutes of Health and from several potential industrial
partners on future funding. Meanwhile, he continues to report from the
study's existing data, with several papers to appear soon on running
performance and statin drugs (widely used for lowering cholesterol) and
the benefits of running in people with high cholesterol.
