When I was a kid and a comedian came on TV, I would just freeze and stare at them. Being obsessed with comedy felt very liberating, because it didn't have to do with the real world. You know, a Mad Magazine, you would start reading it and you're going, 

## "Well, these people don't respect anything." And that just exploded my head. 

It was just, like, you don't have to buy it. 

You could say, "That's stupid." "This is stupid." 

Then, one day, my friend's older brother told us there was this place in New York where young guys were getting on stage and doing stand-up comedy. Not like the guys on Ed Sullivan with tuxedos and cigars, just young, crazy people. Once I saw that this was going on, that there was a world, I went, "Oh, I want to be in that world. I don't want to be in the real world." So, I came into the city in 1976.
