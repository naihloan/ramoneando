[When I first wrote for Running Times in the 1990s, I would mail a 5
1/4" floppy disk to editor Scott Douglas.]{style="font-weight: bold;"}
We subsequently evolved to 3 1/2" disks by snail mail and then
blissfully launched into the Internet age, giving me an extra two days
for writing each month. Technology has changed vastly in the intervening
15 or so years, but how much more do we know about training? In this
article, I scan 15 years of my articles for Running Times (with topics
suggested by editor-in-chief Jonathan Beverly and the enduring Scott
Douglas) and look at when I was right and when, due to subsequent
advances in science and coaching, I was, well, wrong. A bit of
reflection is healthy and occasionally humbling!\
\

[TEMPO RUNS]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\

THEN: In the November 2003 issue, I wrote this about tempo runs:
"Arguably the single most important type of training for distance
runners. Scientific studies have shown that tempo runs are an effective
way to improve lactate threshold pace, which largely determines the pace
you can maintain in a race. Unfortunately, the science does not provide
much detail on how to do tempo runs. As a result, coaches and runners
have interpreted them in a wide variety of ways." At the time, I
recommended tempo runs of 20-45 minutes. By 2006 I had extended them to
50 minutes.\
\
[NOW: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}I wholeheartedly stand by the
endorsement of tempo runs, but am now more open-minded about the range
of effective workouts. Rather than limiting tempo runs to a maximum of
45-50 minutes, I now agree that there are benefits from a slightly less
intense version of up to about 80 minutes. These runs are useful in
preparation for any race of 10K or longer, and particularly for the half
marathon to marathon.\
\
Jerry Schumacher, coach of American 10,000m record-holder Chris
Solinsky, includes these longer tempo runs (Jerry calls them "rhythm
runs") in his athletes' training, with Solinsky gradually increasing his
rhythm runs from 10 miles (50 minutes for Chris) to 18 miles. Solinsky
starts these runs on the easy side and builds into them. Thinking back,
many of the Boston area runners in the 1980s took a similar approach,
starting our long runs relatively slowly and building the pace until we
were approaching marathon race pace for the last 6-10 miles. Jerry and
others have advanced the concept a step further and I bow to their
wisdom.\

\
[RUNNING BAREFOOT]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\
[THEN: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}In the July/August 2002 issue, I
recommended trying barefoot running, saying: "You can strengthen your
feet and ankles by using them as they were designed to be used. Take off
your shoes and let your feet move on natural surfaces. When you walk or
run barefoot, you strengthen the little muscles in your feet which have
been sleeping peacefully in your shoes for years. You also stretch and
strengthen your calf muscles and may improve your running form. The
protection provided by your shoes allows you to get away with sloppy
running style. It is very difficult, however, to run barefoot with bad
technique and almost impossible to overstride."\
\
I then explained, "You need to be very careful when starting a barefoot
running program. Picture your soft little feet muscles and tendons if
you suddenly say to them, 'OK, we're going to start this training
program by landing with 4 times bodyweight several thousand times'--a
sure recipe for injury," and went on to recommend the following way to
start barefoot running: "Before you start running barefoot, you should
walk barefoot for a few weeks to strengthen the muscles in your feet and
ankles and toughen up the skin on the bottom of your feet. Start out by
walking barefoot for 5 to 10 minutes a couple of times each day. You can
also do exercises while walking barefoot such as high knees and walking
on the balls of your feet to prepare your feet for running barefoot."\
\
The column continued, "Start out with 5 minutes at the very most, and
increase slowly, running barefoot every two to three days. After a
couple of months, you may get to where you can run barefoot for 20
minutes, but for some people a few minutes will be all they can handle.
… After a few weeks of running barefoot two or three times per week,
your feet and ankles will be much stronger, which should reduce your
injury risk when running. You should also find that you have more spring
in your step and a slightly longer stride. Approached cautiously,
barefoot running can be a useful and refreshing addition to your
training."\
\
[NOW:]{style="font-weight: bold;"} Barefoot running has boomed since
2002, with many runners ending up on the injury heap from launching into
it too quickly. I stand by both my overall endorsement of barefoot
running and the particularly cautious approach to incorporating it into
training.\
\
[Verdict: RIGHT]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
[DOUBLES]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\
[THEN: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}In the July/August 2000 issue, I
discussed when it's beneficial to run twice per day. My advice was:
"Many elite runners incorporate 'doubles' in some way, and this training
pattern offers a number of benefits. Most runners, however, should
resist the urge to shift from single runs to doubles as they increase
training mileage, and instead add miles to single runs."\
\
I stated, "Do not do double workouts until you have maximized the
training volume you can handle in single daily workouts" and "If you are
preparing for a marathon, do not do doubles unless you are running more
than 75 miles per week."\
\
[NOW:]{style="font-weight: bold;"} I now believe that for older runners,
or those with a history of injury, double runs can be a beneficial way
to run relatively high mileage with less injury risk than longer single
runs. Doubles can also help you improve your stride rate and running
technique because you'll be relatively fresh during your runs and less
likely to get stuck in a marathoner's shuffle. I would now recommend
double runs for runners over 40 preparing for races from 5K through the
marathon any time except their long run day. (My open-mindedness has
limits.) For example, rather than trying to get in a mid-week 11-miler,
if breaking it up into a 7-mile run and a 4-miler will help ensure you
put in the mileage and stay injury-free, then that's a smart option.\
\
[Verdict: RIGHT]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[NOTES: More open-minded now.]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
\
[RUNNING ECONOMY]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\

THEN: In the July/August 2004 issue, I discussed 10 ways to improve your
running economy (how much oxygen you use to run at a given pace). The
basic idea is that if you can run faster using the same amount of oxygen
then your racing performances will improve. I made the following six
training recommendations: "1) run a portion of your training at race
pace; 2) during training, simulate the terrain you will race over; 3)
increase your training mileage; 4) improve your running technique; 5)
eliminate weaknesses; and, 6) taper your training before races" and the
following four recommendations for racing: "1) wear lightweight shoes;
2) draft behind other runners into the wind; 3) relax while racing; and,
4) wear aerodynamic racing gear."\
\
[NOW: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}While each of those factors is still
valid six years later, if I were to rewrite the article, I would put a
much higher emphasis on adding resistance training (strength training)
to improve your running economy. A 2008 review of studies on the effects
of resistance training on running economy in highly trained runners in
the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found an average
improvement in running economy of 4.5 percent after adding six to 14
weeks of weight training or plyometrics. Improvements in running economy
should result in improved racing performances--and 4.5 percent is big!\
\
What kind of resistance training is most effective in improving running
economy and racing performance? At this point we can't be sure, but
studies have found that both heavy weight training and explosive
plyometric training have led to improvements in running economy. As an
added bonus, your running training inhibits hypertrophy, which will
allow you to make strength and power gains without getting bigger
muscles (and added weight). The runners I work with currently do two
resistance training sessions per week, including both traditional
weightlifting exercises (e.g., dead lifts and split squats) and several
explosive plyometric exercises. As with barefoot running, there's a
definite injury risk in the start-up phase, so get advice from an
experienced coach to ensure you're doing the right exercises in the
right amount with the right technique.\
\
[Verdict: RIGHT]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[NOTES: Know more now.]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
\
[WARM-UP]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\

THEN: In the December 2003 issue, I wrote, "The role of the warm-up is
to prepare your body to run hard. When you accelerate to race pace after
the starting gun fires, the physiological demands on your body increase
suddenly and dramatically. For example, the amount of blood pumped by
your heart increases 5 to 6 times, and your oxygen consumption increases
about 15 times. If you do not warm up thoroughly, you put unnecessary
additional strain on your muscles, tendons, ligaments and cardiovascular
system."\
\
My recommendation was to run 10-15 minutes, and then "Stretch gently for
10 to 15 minutes. Stretching will help prepare your muscles for the
longer stride length you use when running fast." I added: "Recent
evidence indicates that prolonged static stretching has a short-term
effect of reducing muscle strength, so limit your stretching to two to
three repetitions per muscle group and do not hold your stretches for
more than 15 seconds. Save your major stretching session for after the
workout or race."\
\
[NOW:]{style="font-weight: bold;"} There's now evidence that dynamic
stretching provides better preparation for racing than static
stretching. In fact, too much static stretching before a race can reduce
running economy, which, as discussed above, would be detrimental to
racing performance.\
\
Dynamic stretching consists of a series of exercises that warm up the
muscles using running-like movements. Dynamic stretching increases your
heart rate and prepares your muscles for the range of motion you'll use
in the race. This more specific warm-up better prepares the muscles and
nervous system for fast running, and can have the added benefit of
improving coordination and running technique. There are many types of
dynamic stretching exercises; they typically include movements such as
lunges, high knees, skip marching and butt kicks. There are a number of
useful videos available showing dynamic stretching routines for
runners.\
\
[Verdict: WRONG]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[]{style="font-weight: bold;"}[]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
[GENDER GAP]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\
[THEN:]{style="font-weight: bold;"} In September 2001, Naoko Takahashi
became the first woman to break 2:20 for the marathon by running 2:19:46
in Berlin. Catherine Ndereba shattered that record a week later, running
2:18:47 in the Chicago Marathon. This quick progression led to a
resurgence of speculation as to whether the best women's marathoners
would ever catch the men.\
\
In the March 2002 issue, I wrote, "Will the gap between men's and
women's marathon world-best times get smaller? Probably, but not by
much. Even with the best 10,000 meter runners such as Paul Tergat and
Haile Gebrselassie now turning to the marathon, the record is unlikely
to drop by more than another minute or so in the next decade. While only
a handful of women have threatened the women's mark to date, it is the
increasing depth of women's distance running worldwide, particularly
from the strong African nations, that will likely see the women's mark
fall by another 2 to 3 minutes in the next 10 years."\
\
[NOW: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}Today, the women's record is 2:15:25
set by Paula Radcliffe in the 2003 London Marathon, and the men's record
is 2:03:59 set by Haile Gebrselassie in the 2008 Berlin Marathon. The
gap between the men's and women's records has decreased from 13 minutes
and 5 seconds in early 2002 to 11 minutes and 26 seconds today. Thank
you, Paula, for improving the women's record by 2 minutes and 22
seconds. If only you were African, my prediction would look pretty good
…\

[VERDICT: RIGHT]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[NOTES: Wrong continent.]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
\
[HYDRATION]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\
[THEN: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}In the June 1995 issue, I wrote,
"Chances are that what makes you slow down in the last few miles of a
marathon (or any event that takes longer than an hour and a half to
complete) is dehydration or glycogen depletion. A few extra miles in
training won't help much, but a well-laid plan to take in water and
carbohydrates both before and during a race can make a huge difference
in your performance."\
\
The article continued, "Before the race, you must concentrate on
carbohydrate loading to increase your muscles' glycogen stores for the
start of the race and on drinking enough water to ensure you're fully
hydrated. During the race, you must take in carbohydrates to prevent
glycogen depletion and take in fluid to prevent dehydration."\
\
[NOW: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}While the fact that dehydration is
one of, if not the most significant factor in causing slowdown in the
later stages of long races, unfortunately, this article may have
contributed to a tendency among some runners to over-drink during races.
Studies have found that some marathoners finish the race weighing more
than at the start, indicating that they've gone overboard in trying to
prevent dehydration. Importantly, in 1995 I didn't discuss the
importance of sodium, but added in a column on the same topic in the
July/August 2006 issue, "The American College of Sports Medicine advises
that, "inclusion of sodium (0.5-0.7 grams per liter of fluid) in the
rehydration solution ingested during exercise lasting longer than one
hour is recommended since it may be advantageous in promoting fluid
retention, and possibly preventing hyponatremia \[dangerously decreased
sodium concentration in the blood\] in certain individuals who drink
excessive quantities of fluid."\
\
We now know that two other recommendations in the 1995 article weren't
right. I advised, "It takes time for your body tissues to absorb water.
You're better off drinking a little at a time frequently than drinking a
lot all at once." Research has now found that drinking more fluid less
frequently, compared to drinking the same amount in smaller, more
frequent intakes, speeds gastric emptying (from your stomach to your
intestines). I also stated, "Avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee,
tea and cola, because caffeine is a diuretic and will leave you less
hydrated." We already discussed that was wrong. Science has clearly
advanced on this topic over the past 15 years.\
\
[VERDICT: RIGHT and
WRONG]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}\
\
[CAFFEINE]{style="font-weight: bold;"}\
\

THEN: In the March 2004 issue, I wrote about whether taking caffeine can
improve running performance: "Several hundred studies have been
conducted on the effects of caffeine on sport performance, and the
answer is: probably. Studies with runners and cyclists have shown that
caffeine can improve performance in the lab during simulated events
lasting from 5 minutes to several hours. Extrapolating from
run-to-exhaustion studies in the lab, the likely benefit of taking
caffeine is in the range of 1 to 2 percent (20 to 50 seconds in a 10K,
90 seconds to 4 minutes in a marathon)."\
\
At the time, I also wrote, "The side effect that is most likely to
reduce running performance is caffeine's diuretic effect. Caffeine may
increase dehydration, which would cancel out its performance-enhancing
benefits. Interestingly, taking caffeine during exercise does not seem
to increase urine formation, and caffeine is less of a diuretic in
individuals who are regular caffeine users."\
\
[NOW: ]{style="font-weight: bold;"}Since 2004, many more studies have
been conducted on the effects of caffeine on athletic performance, and
there's now somewhat more evidence that caffeine can positively affect
performance. According to several of these studies, a dose of 3 to 6 mg
of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight, depending on your individual
response, is still appropriate. Rather than taking caffeine an hour
before racing as recommended in 2004, I know a number of marathoners who
take 3 to 4 mg/kg bodyweight (e.g., 200 mg caffeine) about a half hour
before the start and take more caffeine (e.g., 50 to 100 mg) in the form
of gels during the race. Recent studies have also emphasized that
staying off caffeine for at least three days pre-race will help increase
your sensitivity on race day.\
\
Regarding the diuretic effect of caffeine, however, a couple of studies
were already questioning the view I presented by 2004, and a 2005 study
found that moderate ingestion of caffeine doesn't increase urine output
more than a similar amount of water. I confess to not getting that
right!\
\
The 2004 column concluded, "My view is that runners should only consider
using caffeine if they are already training hard and intelligently, have
an excellent diet, and are working to optimize various other aspects of
their lifestyle. If you decide to try caffeine to improve your race
performance, start with a low dose and do not experiment in an important
race." As a long-time proponent of keeping running as natural as
possible, that's still my view.\
\
[VERDICT: RIGHT and
WRONG]{style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"}\
\
[Wrong then? How about now?]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
\
[If a coach as experienced and knowledgeable as Pete Pfitzinger admits
to being wrong on advice he gave 10 to 15 years ago, how can a runner or
coach know that current advice isn't equally
wrong?]{style="font-style: italic;"}\
\
As demonstrated in an area like stretching, today's wisdom may indeed be
tomorrow's folly. That said, unless taken to excess, it's unlikely that
something like warming up "improperly" with static stretching sabotaged
anyone's running career. Keeping up with the most recent knowledge,
however, may make the difference in garnering a medal or a PR. Runners
and coaches need to be lifelong learners, always holding onto key,
timeless principles, but being willing to adapt as research and
experience add to our collective knowledge of training and racing.\
\
Pfitzinger states, "The pace of change is slow and steady, with roughly
equal contributions from coaches and scientists. There have not been any
fundamental changes in training for distance runners since 1995, but a
variety of advances in specific areas such as hydration, stretching, and
the benefits of resistance training. The basic formula of long runs and
tempo runs is still the backbone of successful training from 8K through
the marathon." --The Editors
