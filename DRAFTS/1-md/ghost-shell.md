1

00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,030

Oxygen levels are dropping.



2

00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,078

Brain function normal.



3

00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:47,543

Cerebral salvage ready to proceed.



4

00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:57,470

Robotic skeleton prepared

and waiting for brain insertion.



5

00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:03,476

Initiate Project 2571.



6

00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,370

Now your eyes are gonna open.



7

00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,832

There.



8

00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,794

You're safe.



9

00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,725

It's okay, just breathe.



10

00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,395

Just breathe.



11

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,147

Breathe.



12

00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,401

Good.



13

00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,236

That's good.



14

00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,074

Hello, Mira.



15

00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,618

I'm Dr. Ouelet.



16

00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,791

Do you remember anything

about the attack?



17

00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,627

What happened?



18

00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,839

I was drowning.



19

00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,592

There's water!



20

00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,803

That's right. You were on a boat.



21

00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,263

A refugee boat.



22

00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,765

It was sunk by terrorists.



23

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,810

Why can't I feel my body?



24

00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,854

Mira, your body was damaged.



25

00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,147

We couldn't save it.



26

00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,816

Only your brain survived.



27

00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,611

We made you a new body.



28

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,654

A synthetic shell.



29

00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,326

But your mind, your soul,



30

00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,077

your "ghost,"



31

00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,662

it's still in there.



32

00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,666

Please.



33

00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,168

Sedate her.



34

00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,684

Will it work?



35

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,853

Absolutely.



36

00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,315

She's a miracle.



37

00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,527

A machine can't lead,

it can only follow orders.



38

00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,864

A machine can't imagine or care or intuit.



39

00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,159

But as a human mind in a cybernetic frame,



40

00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,954

Mira can do all those things, and more.



41

00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,872

The first of her kind.



42

00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,252

She will join Section 9

as soon as she is operational.



43

00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,755

Please, don't do that.



44

00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:46,133

You're reducing a complex human to a machine.



45

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,886

I don't think of her as a machine.



46

00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,681

She's a weapon.



47

00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,684

And the future of my company.



48

00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,041

The first artificially created

memory enhancement.



49

00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545

Sirenum's training protocol

is the fastest and most efficient way



50

00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,714

to develop the abilities

you've always wanted.



51

00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,340

Stronger than ever.



52

00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,718

Experience your power with Pneuma Glove.



53

00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,096

Stronger than ever. Experience your power.



54

00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,349

Cyber-crime is a type-one offence.



55

00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,727

Minimum punishment, 15 years in prison.



56

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,103

Hanka Robotics guarantees



57

00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,481

personal safety and integrity 

against outside threats.



58

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,698

All patrolling air units be advised.



59

00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,284

Possible cyber-crime activity

in the vicinity.



60

00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,287

Airspace in all adjoining areas

to be locked down.



61

00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,372

Section 9 is currently on site.



62

00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,667

Repeat: All patrolling air units be advised.



63

00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,462

Possible cyber-crime activity

in the vicinity.



64

00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,716

This is Major. I'm on site.



65

00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,135

Awaiting instructions.



66

00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,233

I'm human. I'm flawed.



67

00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,945

But I embrace change



68

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,614

and enhancement.



69

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,658

Now there's nothing I can't do.



70

00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,996

Nothing I can't know. Nothing I can't be.



71

00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,457

I want you to listen to something.



72

00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,010

That's my four-year-old daughter.



73

00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,012

In the time it took her to sing that lullaby,



74

00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,722

she learned to speak fluent French.



75

00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,557

Did you know that song...



76

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,060

There's an echo box up here.



77

00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,812

Someone's scanning data traffic.



78

00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,983

Let's see who's worth

this kind of surveillance.



79

00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,364

Accessing hotel security network.



80

00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,079

What are you seeing, sir?



81

00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,413

I've got a lot of hotel to scan.



82

00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,346

Got it. 43rd floor.



83

00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:42,059

Someone contact the President's staff.

Someone's watching him.



84

00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,352

Dr. Osmond,



85

00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,813

what is it you want from us?



86

00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,816

I think it's more about

what Hanka Robotics can do for you.



87

00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:53,571

73% of this world has woken up

to the age of cyber-enhancement.



88

00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,906

You really want to be left behind?



89

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,161

My people embrace cyber-enhancement, as do I.



90

00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,414

But there's no one who really

understands the risk



91

00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,835

to individuality, identity,

messing with the human soul.



92

00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,714

Gentlemen. Excuse me.

I think you have the wrong...



93

00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,971

Hallway. Six men. Shots fired.



94

00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,806

Section 9 ETA?



95

00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,641

- Two minutes out, Major.

- Too long.



96

00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,518

I'm going in.



97

00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:42,119

I've heard this speech before

from your competitors.



98

00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,663

And now Hanka Robotics

serves it with milky sake.



99

00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:45,956

What are you doing?



100

00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,376

Look. This is what I'm talking about.



101

00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:23,911

Initiate the hack.



102

00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,282

Help me. Please. Don't let me die.



103

00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,408

Who sent you?



104

00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,118

Help me. Please.



105

00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,328

Answer me!



106

00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,248

Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

and be destroyed.



107

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,811

You okay?



108

00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,441

You're injured.



109

00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,161

You're not the same.



110

00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,415

It's just a robot!



111

00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,332

Your skin deserves the best, and so do you.



112

00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,667

Try our hand cream.



113

00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,815

So, what do we have on Osmond?



114

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,983

So far, very little.



115

00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,237

He was the head of Hanka's robotics division.



116

00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,907

Human, but of course cyber-enhanced.



117

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,492

So how did they hack him?



118

00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,578

Somehow this geisha bot

got past his encryption.



119

00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,038

Something's different.



120

00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,706

What'd you get?



121

00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,334

Why do you always think

he's out there enhancing?



122

00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,919

Because he is.



123

00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,379

Cyber-mech liver.



124

00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,756

Been saving up for a while.



125

00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,591

Now it's last call every night.



126

00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,093

You got enhanced so you can drink more?



127

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,096

Embrace the enhancements, Togusa.



128

00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,432

We wouldn't be here without it.



129

00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,267

I'm all human and happy, thanks.



130

00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,563

Any more information

about the ceased geisha bot?



131

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,898

Hanka's running scans.



132

00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,359

Dr. Dahlin will have the reports ready by...



133

00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,251

Following last night's attack,



134

00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,837

three more Hanka scientists were murdered



135

00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,673

at the company's central laboratory.



136

00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,634

The first two were shot,



137

00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,761

and the third was beaten to death



138

00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,471

by his own service robot.



139

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,559

All showed signs of cerebral hacking.



140

00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,978

The same as the geisha did to Osmond.



141

00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,941

And all were senior figures at Hanka,



142

00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,526

just like Osmond.



143

00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,573

A message was left at each

of the crime scenes by someone



144

00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,324

identifying himself



145

00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,995

as Kuze.



146

00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,332

Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

and be destroyed.



147

00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,088

Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

and be destroyed.



148

00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,259

Togusa.



149

00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,045

I had to or more would have died.



150

00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,887

I will find him and I will kill him.



151

00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,682

It's what I am built for, isn't it?



152

00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,083

Locus Solus,



153

00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,753

safely reconfiguring

your child's genetic structure.



154

00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,172

Families built better.



155

00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,508

What was going on with you

at the hotel last night?



156

00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,842

Nothing. I'm fine.



157

00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,094

You sure?



158

00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,139

- Hey, sweetheart, you want an upgrade?

- Move. Move.



159

00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,308

- I have anything you want.

- Back off!



160

00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,647

- Hey, Ming!

- Hey, Batou!



161

00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,985

- I got your bones.

- Thanks, man.



162

00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,154

For the dogs.



163

00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,281

For someone who doesn't like people,



164

00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,950

how come you care about dogs so much?



165

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,036

Don't know.

I just like strays, and they like me.



166

00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,497

They like you because you feed them.



167

00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,416

You got no heart.



168

00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,376

Hey, girls!



169

00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,508

Hey, Gabriel.



170

00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,593

Meet Major.



171

00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,512

Major, Gabriel.



172

00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,476

We used to have a dog.



173

00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,644

Seriously?



174

00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,609

I had you down as more of a cat person.



175

00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,366

You don't talk about that stuff, huh?



176

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,451

What?



177

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,162

- Your past.

- I don't remember much.



178

00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,414

Just fragments. Bits and pieces.



179

00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,126

What about family?



180

00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,670

My parents, they died

bringing us to this country.



181

00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,172

Our boat sank in the harbour.



182

00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,591

I almost drowned.



183

00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,761

It feels like



184

00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,180

there's always this thick fog

over my memory



185

00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,056

and I can't see through it.



186

00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:06,975

You're lucky.



187

00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:10,270

Every single day

I get screwed by my memories.



188

00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,646

It's better to be pure.



189

00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,607

Like you.



190

00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,586

Welcome to Hanka Robotics.



191

00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,633

All visitors must display

appropriate credentials at all times.



192

00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,597

Open and close, please.



193

00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,935

You have damaged internal systems.



194

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,437

Maybe next time, you can design me better.



195

00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,192

How are you?



196

00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,485

I'm fine. I can't feel anything.



197

00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,404

No, you. In there.



198

00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,908

I've been having glitches.



199

00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,118

But they'll pass.



200

00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:08,954

You've been taking your medication?



201

00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,497

Yeah.



202

00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,123

But these ones are still cycling.



203

00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,042

I had two this morning.



204

00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,919

- Sound or image?

- Both.



205

00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,925

I see it.



206

00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,136

Have you made any unencrypted downloads?



207

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,681

- No. Just delete them for me.

- Consent?



208

00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,057

My name is Major Mira Killian,



209

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,518

and I give my consent

to delete this data.



210

00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,353

It's done.



211

00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,772

- No big deal.

- What are they?



212

00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,776

Sensory echoes from your mind. Shadows.



213

00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:40,986

Can't be sure.



214

00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,113

How do you know

what's a glitch and what's me?



215

00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,032

The glitches have a different texture



216

00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,285

to the rest of your code.



217

00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,247

I can see everything.



218

00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,127

All of your thoughts, your decisions.



219

00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,045

I guess privacy is just for humans.



220

00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,964

You are human.



221

00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,301

People see you as human.



222

00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,970

Everyone around me seems to fit.



223

00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:10,765

They seem connected to something,

something I am



224

00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,601

not.



225

00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,022

- It's like I have no past.

- Of course you have a past.



226

00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,232

And with time you'll feel more

and more connected to it,



227

00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,650

and to them.



228

00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,780

Open and close, please.



229

00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,585

We cling to memories as if they define us,



230

00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,379

but they really don't.



231

00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,216

What we do is what defines us.



232

00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,430

You are entering a Hanka secure area.



233

00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,098

Authorised personnel only.



234

00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,852

Please disable communication enhancements.



235

00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,270

I'm busy.



236

00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,731

Dr. Dahlin! Are you finished yet?



237

00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,442

If you hadn't riddled 

the geisha with bullets,



238

00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,735

this would be much easier.



239

00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,154

- I didn't shoot her.

- I did.



240

00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,282

This is gonna take days.



241

00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,494

I need to run hundreds

of potential simulations.



242

00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,620

We don't have the time.



243

00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,542

She was a Hanka companion bot.



244

00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,672

But she was reprogrammed for cerebral hacking.



245

00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,549

What was on her drives?



246

00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,093

Nothing.



247

00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,886

The data was destroyed as it was transmitted.



248

00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,889

No sign what she was after.



249

00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,475

The hardware was vandalised.



250

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,894

They ripped her up!



251

00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,604

Then I have to do a Deep Dive.



252

00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,316

You can't encrypt during a Deep Dive.



253

00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,859

I know.



254

00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,321

They could have left traps in her.



255

00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,824

Mag pulses. Viruses.



256

00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,242

She's right.



257

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,453

You'll be exposing your mind

to whoever hacked her.



258

00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,913

You'll be wide open.



259

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,252

I have to get inside her memory.



260

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,129

It's the fastest way to find Kuze.



261

00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,053

It's too dangerous.



262

00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,431

And highly irresponsible.



263

00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:20,937

Are you sure?



264

00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,648

You see any bad code

headed my way, pull me out.



265

00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,695

How come you're the one sweating?



266

00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,538

Run it.



267

00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,716

Cyber-mind connection to the Major



268

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,885

now active and unencrypted.



269

00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,222

Consent required for data download.



270

00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,642

My name is Major Mira Killian,

and I give my consent.



271

00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,416

Thank you.



272

00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,536

Disconnect. Get her out.



273

00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,037

Get her out!



274

00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,039

I'm trying, but she's being hacked.



275

00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,586

Get her out now!



276

00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,591

Now!



277

00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,719

Are you okay?



278

00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,140

I know where he is.



279

00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,739

I know this place.



280

00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,200

They run black market mech.



281

00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,869

- You tooled up?

- Yep.



282

00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,371

Target's the basement. I'll lead.



283

00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,123

Switching to mind-comms.



284

00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,376

- Hope you've been practising.

- That's unfair.



285

00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,047

It just takes me a moment to



286

00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,590

get the hang of it.



287

00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,895

Two mercs at the doors. Armed and enhanced.



288

00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,814

Copy that. We've got it covered.



289

00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,619

There's a lot of heat in here

for a nightclub.



290

00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,997

It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?



291

00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,624

I quite like the place.



292

00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,126

Why doesn't that surprise me?



293

00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,712

I'm gonna have to draw some attention,



294

00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,965

see if I can access the basement that way.



295

00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,971

You're not here looking for any trouble,

are you?



296

00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:26,224

I'm just here for the girls and the beer.



297

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,938

- Can I help you?

- I'm looking for someone.



298

00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,564

You been here before?



299

00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,359

My friend had some mech work

done here. Industry stuff.



300

00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,027

We don't do mech work here.



301

00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,362

My mistake.



302

00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,615

Why don't you come have fun with us?



303

00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,033

We'll have some privacy.



304

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,167

I'm in.



305

00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,503

I'll be here when you need me.



306

00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,309

You say your friend worked here?



307

00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,186

I said my friend had work done here.



308

00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,689

She's human?



309

00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,733

Your friend.



310

00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,319

Now what's that supposed to mean?



311

00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:20,486

Batou.



312

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,155

Can you hear me?



313

00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:26,242

Who did this stunning work on you?



314

00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,952

It's divine.



315

00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,252

Ladriya. Guns.



316

00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,588

Here.



317

00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,426

Batou, I'm losing signal.



318

00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,595

Don't worry, sweetie.



319

00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,014

We have privacy.



320

00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,558

Listen.



321

00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,561

No signals going in or out.



322

00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,273

Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?



323

00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,192

Beer.



324

00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,654

If you don't answer,

you're gonna hurt my feelings.



325

00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,040

Ladriya, do you have Major on comms?



326

00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,667

Got nothing. Signal's still blocked.



327

00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,921

I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so,



328

00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,090

if you don't want to talk,



329

00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,052

maybe you want to dance!



330

00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,515

Major, come on. Answer me.



331

00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,574

I thought you said no trouble.



332

00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,618

Dance.



333

00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,164

No! Enough!



334

00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,334

The truth is,



335

00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,712

I wasn't built to dance.



336

00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,978

Back on comms. I'm heading to the back room.



337

00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,690

I missed you. I'll meet you there.



338

00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,433

Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

and be destroyed.



339

00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,237

Major?



340

00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,813

Where's Batou?



341

00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,567

In Enhancement next door. He's doing well.



342

00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,821

You took most of the blast.



343

00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,492

I saw him down there.



344

00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,037

It was like



345

00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,332

he waited to see me.



346

00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,043

We synaptic-scanned you.



347

00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,714

Everything you witnessed went

to Section 9 to evaluate.



348

00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,260

You know, the scan



349

00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,679

also turned up a number of glitches.



350

00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,974

They've been getting worse.



351

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,685

Since when?



352

00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,021

Since the Deep Dive.



353

00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,415

Do any of the glitches mean something to you?



354

00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,126

No.



355

00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,045

They don't.



356

00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,050

You've been inside the same shell as he has.



357

00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:38,804

That could have very serious consequences.



358

00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:43,059

You were not authorised

to Deep Dive the geisha.



359

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,561

You're disappointed.



360

00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,065

No, I'm worried.



361

00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,235

You're not invulnerable.



362

00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,907

I can repair your body,

but I can't protect your mind.



363

00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,909

Why not?



364

00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,581

You can see all my thoughts,



365

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,084

so you should be able to secure them.



366

00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,672

Try and understand your importance, Mira.



367

00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,594

You're what everyone will become one day.



368

00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,433

You don't know how alone that makes me feel.



369

00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,786

I can see you out there, you know.



370

00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,541

How many fingers am I holding up?



371

00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,668

Funny.



372

00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,304

Say something nice.



373

00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,141

You chose those?



374

00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,268

They're tactical.



375

00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:11,147

- Always for the job.

- What else I got?



376

00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,733

- They suit you.

- Yeah?



377

00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,569

I got night-vision, mile-zoom,



378

00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,070

and X-ray.



379

00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,449

I guess I see like you now.



380

00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,660

Don't worry. You'll get used to it.



381

00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,039

Thanks for saving my ass.



382

00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,959

Glad to see you're okay.



383

00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:33,836

Major?



384

00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,339

Could you feed the dogs for me?



385

00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,009

I don't want to scare them.



386

00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,844

Anytime.



387

00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,599

Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?



388

00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,895

Is Section 9 missing some

critical operational resource?



389

00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:40,528

Major is our most sophisticated weapon

only if she's intact.



390

00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,906

And Dr. Ouelet informed me



391

00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,867

that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.



392

00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,253

You realise the supreme importance



393

00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,088

that Hanka represents to this government.



394

00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,175

Major is the future of my company.



395

00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,345

If you compromise her systems again,



396

00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,931

I will burn this section.



397

00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,116

Come here. With me.



398

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,913

Create your own beauty. Beauty enhanced.



399

00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,133

You human?



400

00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:28,969

Yeah.



401

00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,268

Can you take that off



402

00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:39,021

so I can see your face?



403

00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,465

What does that feel like?



404

00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,591

It feels



405

00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,885

different.



406

00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,773

What are you?



407

00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:00,269

Look at me.



408

00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,607

Tell me what they took from me.



409

00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,237

I'm sorry. They never told us.



410

00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:35,971

It feels weird driving with these eyes.



411

00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,060

Why do you take that?



412

00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:44,188

It keeps my brain from rejecting this body.



413

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,776

Major, Batou, you need to get here.



414

00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,319

What have you got?



415

00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,905

Another Hanka scientist has been found dead.



416

00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,156

It's Dahlin.



417

00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,616

Got it.



418

00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,625

Major, this way.



419

00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,155

What is that?



420

00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,535

She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.



421

00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:44,331

It's a list of everyone who worked

on a project called 2571.



422

00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,875

That's who he's targeting.



423

00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,169

Is anyone else on the list?



424

00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,508

Find Ouelet. Now!



425

00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:57,594

She's in transit. Her comms are down.



426

00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,351

I'm looking at her and I'm thinking,



427

00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,854

"You want me to pay for violin, too."



428

00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,522

Don't get me wrong.



429

00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,358

I love that kid to pieces.



430

00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,402

I do. She's amazing.



431

00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,030

But when she practises that thing,

it is painful, right?



432

00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:18,615

Why not piano?



433

00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:21,660

I mean, it's the same price, you know?



434

00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,370

And doesn't sound so bad.



435

00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:29,001

At least, if you can't play that proper,

it sounds...



436

00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:20,135

2571. Tell me everything!



437

00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:34,149

Are you prepared to die for 257...



438

00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:44,368

Go!



439

00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,092

Go!



440

00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,796

Where's Kuze?

Why does he want to kill Ouelet?



441

00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,089

I don't know anything.



442

00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,010

Enough! Enough!



443

00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,430

We need him alive.



444

00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,062

Please, I've been through this.



445

00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,148

You have the wrong guy.



446

00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,652

So tell us who we do have.



447

00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:28,490

My name is Lee Cunningham.



448

00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,162

- Where'd you get the weapons?

- I don't know.



449

00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:35,414

Who loaded them onto the truck?



450

00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,958

I don't know anything about weapons,

all right? I told you!



451

00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,419

I was picking up my daughter.

She takes violin lessons.



452

00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,962

What's her name?



453

00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:47,008

- Is this her?

- Yeah.



454

00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,053

Isn't she a little angel?



455

00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:51,721

- This is your daughter?

- Right.



456

00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,268

Do you have kids?



457

00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:01,481

Where do you live?



458

00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,818

I can't remember.



459

00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:08,155

I think it's a tall place.

Is it a tall building?



460

00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:10,115

It's a tall place, right?



461

00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,868

You don't have a child.



462

00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:18,165

You don't have a wife. You live alone.



463

00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:20,041

- It's just you.

- What? No.



464

00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,585

We've been to your apartment.

There's nobody there.



465

00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:22,878

- No.

- You've lived there



466

00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,004

- for 10 years by yourself.

- No!



467

00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,046

So you're just lying.



468

00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,339

I'm not lying!



469

00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,551

I didn't kill anyone!



470

00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:31,970

- Why do you keep doing this to me?

- Holo cube disconnect.



471

00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,054

Please!



472

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,932

I didn't do anything!



473

00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,059

Why do you keep saying this to me?



474

00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:40,645

I don't understand. How can he not know?



475

00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:44,858

The hack must have created a vacuum.

Kuze's wiped his memory



476

00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,402

and somehow installed a new reality.



477

00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,615

At least, he got to believe he had a kid.



478

00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,576

What's the difference?



479

00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,871

Fantasy, reality.



480

00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,664

Dreams, memories.



481

00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,709

It's all the same.



482

00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,920

Just noise.



483

00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:07,547

It's him.



484

00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,093

He's in there.



485

00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:17,224

This cube is secure. He can't be, Major.



486

00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:18,975

Lie detector.



487

00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:20,435

He must've hacked in that way.



488

00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,895

We should uplink to the machine,



489

00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,438

trace the code, get a lock on his location.



490

00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,773

Do it.



491

00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,234

Don't go in there. It's too dangerous!



492

00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:45,460

The signal's unstable.



493

00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:46,878

- Can you get a lock on it?

- Think so.



494

00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:48,964

We gotta move fast. We're losing it.



495

00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,757

Connecting.



496

00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:54,052

Who are you?



497

00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,473

Come here.



498

00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,143

I am shy.



499

00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,730

I'm not beautiful



500

00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:06,815

like you.



501

00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,028

Tell me who you are.



502

00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:15,198

I have been born more than once.



503

00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:18,493

So I have more than one name.



504

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,704

I'll find you.



505

00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,372

Not yet.



506

00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,708

I'm not done.



507

00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,960

The machine is tracing his location.



508

00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:28,670

We got a fix!



509

00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,469

I need to see her.



510

00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,221

No, please. I know...



511

00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,764

We got him.



512

00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,149

Let's go.



513

00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,748

Weapons up.



514

00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,044

- Go.

- On me.



515

00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,927

Stay down! Stay down!



516

00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,563

Put it down. Put it down.



517

00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:18,655

Grenade!



518

00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,005

Major!



519

00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,840

Come in.



520

00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,010

I know why we couldn't find him.



521

00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:28,349

He's using human minds

to create a network of his own.



522

00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,726

We're coming to your position.



523

00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,095

Tell me who you are.



524

00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,935

I am that which you seek to destroy.



525

00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:00,233

In this life my name is



526

00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:02,110

Kuze.



527

00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,073

What are you doing to me?



528

00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:14,789

I have connected you to

a network of my own creation.



529

00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,292

When I am finished in this world,



530

00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:22,255

my ghost can survive there and regenerate.



531

00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,757

What do you want from me?



532

00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,510

I became



533

00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,221

fascinated with you,



534

00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:34,183

reading your code



535

00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,811

while you were inside that geisha.



536

00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,942

Like nothing I had felt before and yet so



537

00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:45,320

familiar.



538

00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:48,990

We are the same.



539

00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:52,118

We are not the same.



540

00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,456

You kill innocent people.



541

00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:59,334

"Innocent," is that what you call them?



542

00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,670

I am as they made me.



543

00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,340

Who made you?



544

00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,425

What have they told you?



545

00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,053

That you were the first?



546

00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:13,097

The first cerebral salvage?



547

00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:17,685

You were born of lessons took



548

00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:19,479

from my failure.



549

00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,483

What are you talking about?



550

00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:27,445

I was conscious while they dismembered



551

00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,656

my body and discarded me



552

00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,908

like garbage.



553

00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,703

I was lying on a table,



554

00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:41,250

listening to doctors talk about how

my mind had not meshed with the shell



555

00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:42,835

that they had built.



556

00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:47,757

How Project 2571



557

00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,217

had failed,



558

00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,886

and they had to move on



559

00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,519

to you.



560

00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:08,987

What a beauty you are.



561

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,617

They have improved us so much



562

00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:16,744

since they made me.



563

00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:24,168

They thought that we would be

a part of their evolution,



564

00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:26,838

but they have created us



565

00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,298

to evolve alone,



566

00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:35,680

beyond them.



567

00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:38,725

"Evolution," that's what you call



568

00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:41,602

killing everyone who made you?



569

00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:44,105

You're not listening to me.



570

00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,399

You're a murderer.



571

00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:49,444

They tried to kill me first.



572

00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:53,406

It is self-defence.



573

00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,450

Defence of self!



574

00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,996

More will die



575

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,916

until they tell me



576

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,002

what they took!



577

00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:07,503

I won't let that happen.



578

00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,340

You want to kill me?



579

00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,972

Like everyone else.



580

00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:25,980

Do it then.



581

00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,319

Do what you were programmed to do.



582

00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:44,540

What is that?



583

00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,221

What is that?



584

00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:03,851

I can't remember, but I am haunted by it.



585

01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,479

Do you see it?



586

01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:12,944

Togusa!



587

01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:22,411

Don't take the medication that they give you.



588

01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:25,706

They use it to suppress your memories.



589

01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:30,128

Your shell belongs to them,

but not your ghost.



590

01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,421

Your ghost is yours.



591

01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,465

Remember that,



592

01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:37,593

and maybe you can remember it all.



593

01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:48,396

Get away from her!

Get down on the ground, now!



594

01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:55,570

Major!



595

01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:05,746

Major!



596

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,017

Mira.



597

01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,603

My God, you're safe!



598

01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:32,857

You've been gone for hours!



599

01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,235

No one knew where you were.



600

01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,283

What?



601

01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,204

You're scaring me.



602

01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,583

Calm down.



603

01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:56,797

How many were there before me?



604

01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:03,846

The intricacies of shelling your mind,

it had never been done before.



605

01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,515

It was inevitable there would be failures.



606

01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,477

How many?



607

01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:14,982

Dozens.



608

01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,280

How many?



609

01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:27,995

Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts

before you.



610

01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:32,750

You killed 98 innocent people.



611

01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,336

No, I didn't kill anyone.



612

01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:40,841

You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't exist

if it weren't for those experiments.



613

01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,677

"Experiments"?



614

01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:46,847

- Is that what I am to you?

- No!



615

01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,518

No, Mira!



616

01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:57,942

Sacrifices were made.



617

01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:02,697

Where did the bodies come from?



618

01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,701

Where did I come from?



619

01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:10,037

Mr. Cutter brought them to us.



620

01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:12,498

I didn't ask questions.



621

01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,041

The harbour!



622

01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,335

My parents.



623

01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:18,671

The way they died.



624

01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,258

Did that happen?



625

01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,429

No.



626

01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,976

We gave you false memories.



627

01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:34,979

Cutter wanted to motivate you



628

01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,689

to fight terrorists.



629

01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:37,982

I didn't approve.



630

01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:41,569

It was cruel, but my work, it was important,



631

01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,988

and you were born.



632

01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:47,074

You were so beautiful.



633

01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,912

Nothing I have is real.



634

01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:55,916

I found him.



635

01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,294

I told you to be careful.



636

01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:01,380

You knew who he was the whole time.



637

01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:02,798

You built him.



638

01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:08,596

He had a violent, unstable mind.



639

01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:12,058

His cerebral connections wouldn't hold!



640

01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,393

- I tried to save him!

- No.



641

01:04:15,311 --> 01:04:17,104

You left him to die.



642

01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:29,784

Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.



643

01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,535

Checking upper zones next.



644

01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:34,830

Is there any word on Major?



645

01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,463

Copy that, sir.



646

01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:45,091

I know where to find her.



647

01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,553

I didn't ask you to come here.



648

01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,514

You never ask.



649

01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:35,349

But I always do.



650

01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,689

Did they send you to bring me in?



651

01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:46,193

I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?



652

01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,779

You're a company man. You follow orders,



653

01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:50,823

so if they ordered you to kill me...



654

01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:54,034

Stop saying shit like that.

You're gonna piss me off.



655

01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,059

What's it like down there?



656

01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,896

It's cold and dark.



657

01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,399

Just a million miles away.



658

01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,152

No voices.



659

01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,821

No data streaming.



660

01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,282

Just



661

01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:37,495

nothing.



662

01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,919

- It scares me.

- Then why do you do it?



663

01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,053

It feels real.



664

01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,180

Why didn't you stop him?



665

01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,769

I don't know who to trust anymore.



666

01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,271

You trust me, right?



667

01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,319

Yeah, I do.



668

01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,574

I just don't like it.



669

01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,125

I need you to take me back.



670

01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:27,795

There's more I need to find out.



671

01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,717

Sure.



672

01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:53,445

Dr. Ouelet,



673

01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,031

what have you told her?



674

01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,493

She knows.



675

01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,329

I'm bringing her in.



676

01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:35,195

Hanka Security to headquarters.



677

01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:37,698

We have the Major.



678

01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:16,320

Why is she sedated?



679

01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,406

She's been turned by a terrorist.



680

01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,284

But you know that already.



681

01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,248

You should've called the first time

she came to see you.



682

01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,334

Instead, you gave her information.



683

01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,586

What makes you think

you have the right to tell me



684

01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,214

- what to do and what...

- 2571 took us close.



685

01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:37,132

It's time to move on to the next iteration.



686

01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:38,592

2571 is not a failure.



687

01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:40,844

I'll delete all the data and reprogram her.



688

01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:42,429

She won't remember him at all!



689

01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:44,348

No. No, no, no.



690

01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:47,476

You download all the data on the terrorist,



691

01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,020

and then I order you to terminate.



692

01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:54,400

What?



693

01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:56,944

You'll build one that's better.



694

01:09:57,528 --> 01:10:00,572

- I'll delete everything.

- You've deleted before.



695

01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,994

- She's mine.

- No.



696

01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:08,580

She's a contract. With me.



697

01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,416

We succeeded.



698

01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:13,919

She's more than human and more than A.I.



699

01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,922

We changed her entire identity.



700

01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,590

But her ghost survived!



701

01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:20,968

Her ghost is what failed us.



702

01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,011

We cannot control her.



703

01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,847

She's no longer a viable asset.



704

01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:32,646

You should be the one to do it.



705

01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,324

What are you doing to me?



706

01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,120

I'll run the standard synaptic,



707

01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:50,956

upload your data on the raid,



708

01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:53,792

find out exactly what Kuze told you.



709

01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,755

You know what he told me.



710

01:10:58,005 --> 01:10:59,339

The truth.



711

01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:05,554

You're deleting everything, aren't you?



712

01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:06,680

No.



713

01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:11,393

Make it so I don't remember



714

01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:13,270

you.



715

01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:25,407

My name is Major Mira Killian,



716

01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:29,536

and I do not consent

to the deletion of this data.



717

01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,874

I do not consent.



718

01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,378

I do not consent.



719

01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:41,381

We never needed your consent.



720

01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,262

Yours or anyone's.



721

01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,936

You're killing me,



722

01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:56,563

aren't you?



723

01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,084

Mira?



724

01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:20,921

You hear me?



725

01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:25,717

Mira?



726

01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,057

This is your past, your real past. Take it.



727

01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:35,185

- Guards!

- Come on, come on!



728

01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,687

Come on, go!



729

01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:44,862

Go.



730

01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,572

Go!



731

01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:56,498

Please relocate to your designated safe room.



732

01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,959

Security alert on level 25.



733

01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,796

Initiating lockdown procedure.



734

01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,716

Please relocate to your designated safe room.



735

01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:07,509

Thank you for your cooperation.



736

01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,473

That's the problem with the human heart.



737

01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,060

She killed Dr. Ouelet!



738

01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,187

You're to have no further contact with her.



739

01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,939

Hanka Security will hunt her from here.



740

01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,358

- What are their orders?

- To terminate on sight.



741

01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,360

You want to kill her? You built her!



742

01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:07,778

Have your sergeant stand down.



743

01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,780

The Major would never harm Dr. Ouelet!



744

01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,531

She's not the Major anymore!



745

01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,035

We have a Section 9 operative

under terrorist programing.



746

01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:17,746

This goes public, your unit goes down.



747

01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,379

I'll take that under advisement.



748

01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:30,509

So what now?



749

01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,356

Pumpkin!



750

01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:29,109

You surprised me.



751

01:15:31,862 --> 01:15:33,739

She likes you.



752

01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:36,033

I was looking for...



753

01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,659

Come in.



754

01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,287

Yeah, come, come.



755

01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,377

Can I offer you some tea?



756

01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:49,212

Okay.



757

01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,975

That's Motoko's room.



758

01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,271

My daughter died a year ago.



759

01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,149

I'm sorry.



760

01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:11,359

She ran away.



761

01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,071

She was difficult.



762

01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,991

And we fought.



763

01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:23,538

But I guess we all fight

with our parents, right?



764

01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:26,750

Please come and sit, yeah?



765

01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:49,189

What happened to her?



766

01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:52,025

I don't know.



767

01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:58,490

The ministry sent me her ashes,



768

01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,494

and they told me she took her own life.



769

01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:08,959

But Motoko... No, no, no.



770

01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:12,170

I never believed them.



771

01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:14,881

She was happy,



772

01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,593

living in the lawless zone with her friends.



773

01:17:19,344 --> 01:17:22,848

She'd write her manifestos about



774

01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:28,562

how technology was destroying the world.



775

01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,440

Then, one day,



776

01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,152

the police came,



777

01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:36,570

and they ran.



778

01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,663

It's strange.



779

01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,965

I see her in so many young women.



780

01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:01,094

On the street, in my dreams.



781

01:18:01,636 --> 01:18:04,306

As if she's still here.



782

01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:06,933

She was



783

01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:09,186

fearless!



784

01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:13,607

And wild.



785

01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,776

You remind me of her.



786

01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:19,446

Sorry.



787

01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,911

How do I remind you of her?



788

01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:30,290

The way you look at me.



789

01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:37,672

Who are you?



790

01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:42,886

I don't know.



791

01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:45,972

Wait, wait, wait!



792

01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,352

Will you come again to visit me?



793

01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,480

I will.



794

01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,383

Aramaki.



795

01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:23,385

Listen to me.



796

01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,263

I was never in a terrorist bombing.



797

01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,014

My parents,



798

01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,309

everything was data

they installed in my mind.



799

01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,938

And there were others.



800

01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,856

Runaways like me



801

01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,484

considered disposable.



802

01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:42,904

Kuze was one of them. That's why he's coming.



803

01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,115

For Hanka.



804

01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,704

Dr. Ouelet can.



805

01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,636

Put me on the grid.



806

01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,887

I need Kuze to find me.



807

01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:14,561

I know. But I need to do this.



808

01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,328

The virus has spread.



809

01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,520

We've located Major on the grid.



810

01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,189

She's in the lawless zone.



811

01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:06,357

Air support five minutes out.



812

01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,486

Is the spider tank within range?



813

01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,364

Yes, sir. Awaiting your orders, sir.



814

01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:17,804

Hideo!



815

01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:19,597

Motoko!



816

01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,667

It is real.



817

01:25:33,338 --> 01:25:35,048

This place.



818

01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,099

I remember what they did to us.



819

01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:47,894

Cutter and his men.



820

01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:50,021

This is where they took us from.



821

01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:58,571

We used to sleep right here.



822

01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:02,575

We were like a family,



823

01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:04,702

all of us runaways.



824

01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,872

We had nothing,



825

01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:13,503

except each other.



826

01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:18,800

They took that from us.



827

01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,610

Your name was Hideo.



828

01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:50,456

Motoko.



829

01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:54,877

That was your name.



830

01:26:58,464 --> 01:26:59,799

Motoko.



831

01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,929

Come with me



832

01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:08,307

into my network.



833

01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,477

We will evolve beyond them.



834

01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,941

And together, we can avenge

what they have done to us.



835

01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:18,317

Come



836

01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:20,528

with me.



837

01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,131

I'll take control from here.



838

01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:42,175

Weapons system manual command.



839

01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,012

Spider tank now active.



840

01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:56,939

It's Cutter! He found us!



841

01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:36,414

Target acquired.



842

01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:39,709

No!



843

01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:51,137

Target eliminated.



844

01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:08,738

You came close,



845

01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:10,114

you freak.



846

01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:44,941

Motor centre compromised.



847

01:31:28,317 --> 01:31:30,152

Sniper team on site?



848

01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:32,989

We're approaching the targets now, sir.



849

01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:36,867

Come with me.



850

01:31:38,202 --> 01:31:41,455

There is no place for us here.



851

01:31:46,085 --> 01:31:47,211

No.



852

01:31:52,842 --> 01:31:55,219

I'm not ready to leave.



853

01:31:56,846 --> 01:31:58,514

I belong here.



854

01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:05,104

I will always be there with you



855

01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,815

in your ghost.



856

01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:16,032

Target is in view.



857

01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,450

What are you waiting for?



858

01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:18,576

Do it!



859

01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:22,580

No!



860

01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:24,582

Keep firing.



861

01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,499

Say something nice.



862

01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,502

What's your name?



863

01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:13,506

Aramaki told me you had a name from before.



864

01:33:17,301 --> 01:33:19,011

Motoko.



865

01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:25,976

Major is still in there, right?



866

01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:29,063

I am.



867

01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:59,468

I thought that it might be you.



868

01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:26,412

Please.



869

01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:37,047

Tell him this is justice.



870

01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,425

It's what I was built for.



871

01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:45,598

My name is Major,



872

01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,142

and I give my consent.



873

01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:02,007

You don't have to come here anymore.



874

01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:05,928

I know.



875

01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:43,215

My mind is human.



876

01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:46,844

My body is manufactured.



877

01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:50,889

I'm the first of my kind,



878

01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:54,518

but I won't be the last.



879

01:36:58,647 --> 01:37:02,026

We cling to memories as if they define us.



880

01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:06,238

But what we do defines us.



881

01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:15,831

My ghost survived to remind the next of us



882

01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:19,918

that humanity is our virtue.



883

01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,547

I know who I am



884

01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,508

and what I'm here to do.
