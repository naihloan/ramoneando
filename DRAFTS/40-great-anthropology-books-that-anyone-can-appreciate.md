40 Great Anthropology Books That Anyone Can Appreciate
======================================================

November 13th, 2011 by [Staff
Writers](https://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/about/)

Humans studying humans is what anthropology essentially boils down into.
Considering what all the subject entails, it comes as no shock to anyone
at all that many find it absolutely gripping. But not everyone ends up
with a [formal education](https://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/) or
profession in or near the field, thus rendering some reads a little too
technical. But fortunately, a right fair amount of excellent popular
anthropology books exist to make the extremely nuanced topic accessible
to anyone.

As anthropology feeds from such a diverse range of scientific and
liberal arts subjects, this list (which reflects no intentional order)
seeks to reflect that structure rather than focusing on one in
particular. Therefore, many worthwhile reads ended up slashed for space
and time reasons, but that doesn’t mean their words ought to go
unconsidered. Look them up when desiring a much broader glimpse at
humanity’s possible pasts, presents and futures.

    technology, and other factors contributing to anthropology
    (and imperialism) engaging and accessible.

2.  ### *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins

    the basics behind how humans become humans is crucial; renowned
    biologist Richard Dawkins has professionals and hobbyists
    alike covered.

3.  ### *Spoken Here* by Mark Abley

    Languages themselves grow and change in the exact same ways as

    some of the most threatened tongues in the world.

4.  ### *Cod* by Mark Kurlansky

    Readers will believe a fish can, well, not fly, obviously, but at

    the humble cod played in shaping some of mankind’s most
    game-changing moments.

    and misconceptions.

8.  ### *The Body Silent* by Robert F. Murphy

    Murphy opens up about his descent into quadriplegia and the
    unfortunate truths behind perceptions of the disabled it
    eventually revealed.

9.  ### *Motel of the Mysteries* by David Macaulay

    Great for parents and teachers to share with eager kids, *Motel of
    the Mysteries* hilariously satirizes archaeology and anthropology
    while simultaneously offering up some nourishing food for thought
    about their assumptions about ancient peoples.

10. ### *The Origin of Species* by Charles Darwin

    Though not explicitly about humanity, anyone interested in
    anthropology should study the most groundbreaking (not to
    mention controversial) work on genetics and evolution
    ever published.

11. ### *Myth and Meaning* by Claude Levi-Strauss

    This deeply existential read filters the meaning of cultural
    evolution through a philosophical lens, though one not so complex
    general audiences couldn’t enjoy it!

    imprint on human development and history don’t realize, which one
    ethnobotanist discovered when investigating zombie claims.

15. ### *The Lucifer Effect* by Philip Zimbardo

    "Good" and "evil" people and actions form the core of almost every
    civilization’s narrative, so any anthropology buff would do well to
    grasp the psychology behind both heavy concepts.

16. ### *The Botany of Desire* by Michael Pollan

    Apples, marijuana, tulips and potatoes ended up cultivated as a
    direct response to humanity’s specific needs, but for as much
    influence as they’ve had over societies, the societies have heavily
    impacted them in kind.

17. ### *The Mismeasure of Man* by Stephen Jay Gould

    Everything mainstream society assumes about IQ and other methods of
    "measuring" intelligence come crashing down thanks to paleontologist
    Stephen Jay Gould and his twenty tons of science.

    Humans are really nothing more than superintelligent apes, so anyone
    even one iota interested in anthropology should understand their
    relationships with chimpanzees, bonobos and other primates.

19. ### *The Old Way* by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas

    After spending her early adulthood with the Bushmen of the Kalahari,

    contemporary societies relying on so much technology.

20. ### *Alone Together* by Sherry Turkle

    Despite initially trying to hook up with the Amazon’s Piraha peoples
    with conversion intentions, *Don’t Sleep, There are Snakes*‘s author
    grew more and more entranced by what they had to offer, to the point
    he pursued a linguistics career instead!

22. ### *Metaphors We Live By* by George Lakoff

    Figurative language holds far more of a cognitive sway than most
    individuals realize, and this amazing book illustrates the role it
    plays in shaping the world of the past, present and
    possible futures.

23. ### *In the Shadow of Man* by Jane Goodall

    Popular primatologist Jane Goodall’s groundbreaking work with
    Tanzanian chimpanzees benefitted anthropologists as well, since it
    unlocked a few keys regarding human origins and behaviors.

24. ### *Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind* by Maitland Edey and Donald Johanson

    discoveries of all time, and her relationship to today’s humans

    Croatia and Bosnia and how it resulted in some horrific truths about
    humanity’s capacity for great evil.

26. ### *Cloth and the Human Experience* edited by Jane Schneider and Annette B. Weiner

    title on the outside promises: a seriously engaging essay series
    regarding how textiles alters humanity. And, of course, vice versa.

27. ### *The Lonely Crowd* by Reuel Denney, Nathan Glazer and David Reisman

    creation and resulting conformity resulted in some isolationist
    sociological changes.

28. ### *When Religion Becomes Evil* by Charles Kimball

    Most religions have their positives, and can inspire many to go on
    and accomplish amazing acts of humanity and social justice. But when
    it falls into the wrong hands, catastrophes result. Charles Kimball
    outlines five signs to look for in order to determine whether or not
    a sect or segment exists as potentially dangerous.

29. ### *The Power of Babel* by John McWhorter

    along as the author traces how they’ve evolved over millennia.

30. ### *The Mating Mind* by Geoffrey Miller

    here, in an engaging popular anthropology read about how bowm chika
    ow ow time made humanity what it is today.

    components of evolutionary psychology and its intimate interplay
    with anthropology.

32. ### *How the Mind Works* by Steven Pinker

    beautiful, bizarrely beautiful and beautifully bizarre details of
    the human brain in a manner nonprofessionals will surely understand.

    peoples by relating the eponymous woman’s experiences in her
    own words.

34. ### *The First Human* by Ann Gibbons

    Anthropologists, archaeologists and paleontologists are currently

    between humans and their ape ancestors — and it’s certainly a fun
    one to watch unfold!

35. ### *Bowling Alone* by Robert D. Putnam

    American society possesses an uncanny ability to self-destruct,
    building rigid tropes for itself and marginalizing anyone who
    doesn’t fit, leading to increased disengagement.

36. ### *Man and His Symbols* by Carl Jung

    Even individuals who disagree with Carl Jung’s theories regarding
    the collective subconscious and dream interpretation should still

37. ### *Europe and the People Without History* by Eric R. Wolf

    do, as both fields constantly overlap and alter one another.

38. ### *Sweetness and Power* by Sidney W. Mintz
