[[O]{.drop-cap__inner}]{.drop-cap}ne of the most significant fiction
writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular
and titanically influential career. [Alan
Moore](https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-moore){.u-underline} has
promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final
contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his
chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the
superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly
kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.

A brainy pop writer whose style veers between Stephen King and John le
Carré, Moore's influence can be felt everywhere -- in our literature, on
our screens, in our politics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
[quoted](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1083759782098583553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw){.u-underline}
[Watchmen's Rorschach on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1083759782098583553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw){.u-underline},
in response to reports that she was agitating the Democrats. ("I'm not
locked up in here with YOU. You're locked up in here with ME.") Writers
as diverse as [China
Miéville](http://sequart.org/magazine/9367/interview-with-china-mieville/){.u-underline}
and [Ta-Nehisi
Coates](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/05/when-the-world-runs-out-of-room-for-monsters/482835/){.u-underline}
have cited him as inspiration. HBO's great post-Game of Thrones hope is
[yet another adaptation of Moore's most popular
book](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/08/watchmen-trailer-hbo-reveals-first-look-at-superhero-series){.u-underline},
Watchmen, which (co-authored with illustrator Dave Gibbons) has sold
millions of copies since it was first published in 1987. He's [played
himself on The
Simpsons](https://www.simpsonsworld.com/video/294772803561){.u-underline},
seen his work adapted into a number of films -- none very good -- and
even inspired an activist collective: the [Anonymous group wear Guy

as a tribute to V, the anarchist hero of Moore's and illustrator David
Lloyd's V for Vendetta.

Moore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at
punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every
layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts
themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as
detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman's home city
to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote:
"The lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a
territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari,
all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening
alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir
feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you
habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really
intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness." And Moore's
collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this
overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.

Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez
brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was
laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But
Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre --
superheroes -- widely considered to be devoid of them.

![The Joker in Alan Moore's The Killing Joke. Photograph: DC
Comics](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5885fdc0fea33d3f3d21fea35a35e16433bb008f/133_0_1333_800/master/1333.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15b36df2cdd91c91d75d640848afe8b3){.gu-image}

He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in
stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on
forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood
their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed
heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling
bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad -- each of these
characters has moved me to tears.

Moore can be tiresome -- his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah
in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable --
but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop
shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander
Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially
in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O'Neill. One
character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It's quite
moving.

This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features
an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant; yet the
books' central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the
best man a woman could hope for, despite -- or perhaps because of -- his
plant-ness.

Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his
work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly
fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which
published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s
and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often
repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired
pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs. Recently
asked about the real-world political influence of V for Vendetta, [he
was characteristically
blunt](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/572827-how-do-you-feel-about-the-anonymous-and){.u-underline}:
"From my position, if I have had one of my ideas stolen from me and
turned into yet another cash-generator for some abhuman corporation,
then if it has at least escaped into the wild sufficiently to be of some
symbolic use to today's protest movements, that makes me feel a lot
better about having written it in the first place."

At the heart of this antipathy is DC's hold on the legal rights to his
co-creations Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Moore and Gibbons were
promised that all rights would return to them when Watchmen went out of
print, but it never did. Gibbons accidentally predicted what would
happen in this arrangement back in 1986. "What would be horrendous, and
DC could legally do it, would be to have Rorschach crossing over with
Batman or something like that, but I've got enough faith in them that I
don't think they'd do that," he told Neil Gaiman in a public interview
preserved by the Comics Journal.

Moore never got his rights back and DC has spent many years revisiting
Watchmen with lucrative anniversary editions, prequels, a movie, the
forthcoming TV series and indeed Watchmen II, called Doomsday Clock, a
work in progress with script and art by a different creative team. This
will merge the fictional world Gibbons and Moore created with the
universe shared by Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern.

Moore's efforts outside superheroics, such as From Hell, Lost Girls and
A Small Killing, are often cited as proof of his literary worth. But his
greatest contribution to English letters isn't found in his additions to
the growing canon of respectable graphic novels -- a term [Moore has
said](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/22/alan-moore-comic-books-interview){.u-underline}
was invented to allow adults to "validate their continued love of Green
Lantern or Spider-Man without appearing in some way emotionally
subnormal". It's in his dazzling, quixotic overwriting, applied to
trashy genre fiction with an ironic, but never cynical quality. This
worked wonders on uncomplicated planet-tossers like Superman and Captain
Marvel. And when he leaves behind the superhero hijinks, a lot of the
fun leaves the writing along with them. Don't get me wrong, the highbrow
books are still brilliant; they're simply not as enjoyable as the pulpy
stuff.

Many fans have been left in the awkward position of liking Moore's
superhero comics a good deal more than he does himself. When Miracleman
delivers his baby girl and [turns his face toward the
reader](https://books.google.com/books?id=aJiaBAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA36&lpg=RA1-PA36&dq=%22these+are+the+moments+when+we+are+real%22+miracleman&source=bl&ots=LdXbw_zYRp&sig=ACfU3U0xyPKlsfbvioWRDbPMG-lCInm2KA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjs8J6InLbjAhVOLs0KHRY0CNAQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22these%20are%20the%20moments%20when%20we%20are%20real%22%20miracleman&f=false){.u-underline},
his eyes abrim with tears, and his internal monologue proclaims, "These
are the moments when we are real", I have always agreed, despite the
narrator's being clad in a blue leotard.

Moore would be the first to tell you that seriousness isn't always a
virtue, but his was thoroughly transformative. And for many readers,
myself among them, it was a great relief to be taken seriously as a
reader of something supposedly sub-literate and stupid, to be treated
with intelligence and care, and to be introduced to Moore's rebellious
brand of morality: his passionate feminism, his suspicion of authority
and wealth, his love of normal people and veneration of togetherness,
especially in the face of the hopelessness of the real world. His gifts
for cruelty and horror inspired undistinguished competitors to enter the
field, but his unexpected gentleness was what kept readers coming back
to him.
