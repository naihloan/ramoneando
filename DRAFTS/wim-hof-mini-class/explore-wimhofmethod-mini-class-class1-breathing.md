Class 1: The Power of Breathing
-------------------------------

**Warning: Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g.
sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practice it before or
during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or any other
environment/place where it might be dangerous to faint. The breathing
exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is
explained.**

**Available subtitles: EN, NL, DE, FR, ES and PT.**

Breathing Technique Step-by-Step:

-   Step 1: Get Comfortable
-   Step 2: Start to breathe. Fully in (nose/mouth) then let go (mouth),
    continuously, 30-40 times
-   Step 3: Last breath - breathe out, emptying the lungs. Hold for as
    long as you can (no force)
-   Step 4: After the hold, take a deep breath in and hold for 10-15
    seconds
-   Step 5: Repeat the entire process for another 2 or 3 rounds

Breathing Technique Tips

-   Relax. A relaxed body on an empty stomach absorbs more oxygen
-   Feel. Don’t get too hung up on counting, feel how your body responds
-   Observe. Record your thoughts and retention times (but remember it’s
    not a competition)
