**Warning: The cold is a strong force. We strongly advise you to
gradually build up your cold exposure. Always train without force and
listen to your body carefully. If not practiced responsibly, you risk
hypothermia or an 'after drop'. Individuals should also not practice
cold exposure when pregnant, after drinking alcohol, after meals or
during exercise. If you have (serious) health issues, please always
consult a doctor first before practicing.**

**Available subtitles: EN, NL, DE, FR, ES and PT.**
