Today, is better than tomorrow,  
A little, is better than null,   
Breathing, is better than paralized overthinking,   
Peace of mind, is better than rushing,  
Stretching, is better than tight,   
,,
Resting, is better than overwork, except when the goal is special  
Under-eating, is better than overloading, except when low pressure  
Staying sharp, is better than reaching a high goal and quitting, except when too much merits a vacation  
Enjoying and learning, is better than being numb,   
,,
Helpful and thoughtful, is better than self-centered,  
Solitude, is better than no humour,   
Company, is better than not sharing, and it can be super special  
,,
Early to bed, is better than an infinite loop of distractions, except when a Playful Marathon is better as a variation to a loop of unwelcomed lists

This, is better than that, except when it is not, until it is back again
