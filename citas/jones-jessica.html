			&ndash; I need a little bit, you know? Just... Just to wean myself off.<br>
			&ndash; I'm not gonna help you kill yourself.</p>
		<p> 
			&ndash; I mean, why not? I'm useless to you. To anybody.<br>
			&ndash; Yeah, at the moment. Yeah. But, a while ago, you were gonna help people. Social work, right?</p>
		<p> 
			&ndash; Look at me. Who am I gonna help like this?<br>
			&ndash; You have a choice now.</p>
		<p> 
			&ndash; I took pictures of you.<br>
			&ndash; Because he made you.</p>
		<p> 
			&ndash; Sometimes I did it just for the drugs. Think about it, I met him once a day. 10:00 a.m. His controls don't last that long. You know they don't.
			&ndash; That's why he got you hooked, so you would show up.</p>
		<p>
			&ndash; I'm telling you that I had a choice. Kilgrave will find me. I'll be dead anyway. Please just give me my goddamn drugs. Just give me... Just give me my goddamn drugs! <br> 
			&ndash; You're right. I can't save you. The whole time he had me, there was some part of me, <!-- that fought. There was --> some tiny corner of my brain that tried to get out. <!-- And I'm still fighting. I won't stop fighting. --> But if you give up... I lose. Do you get that? <mark>He did this to you to get at me. To isolate me. To make me feel like an infection</mark>, one more person dead or dying because of me. So why don't you remember how to be a goddamn human being again instead of this self-pitying piece of shit that he turned you into, and save me for once? You choose.</p></em>
