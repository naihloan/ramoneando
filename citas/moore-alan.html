<p><em>Ideas, unlike solid structures, do not perish. They remain immortal, immaterial and everywhere, like all Divine things.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a big event in the future and because time is not what we think it is, that event radiates in all directions. We are entering its field and have been for hundreds of years. We are starting to approach the core of it.</em></p>
<p><em>The difference between religion and magic … I think you could map that over those two poles of fascism and anarchism. Magic is closer to anarchism.</em></p>
<p><em>Organised religion has corrupted one of the purest, most powerful and sustaining things in the human condition. It has imposed a middle management, not only in our politics and in our finances, but in our spirituality as well.</em></p>
<p><em>There are people. There are stories. The people think they shape the stories, but the reverse is often closer to the truth.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s only science that cannot consider thought as a real event, and science is not reality. It’s a map of reality, and not a very good one. It’s good, it’s useful, but it has its limits.</em></p>
<p><em>There is an inverse relationship between imagination and money.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a certain amount of sham in shamanism.</em></p>
<p><em>Science looks at the universe, doesn’t see itself there, doesn’t see mind there, so you have a world in which mind has no place.</em></p>
<p><em>The horror is this: In the end, it is simply a picture of empty meaningless blackness. We are alone. There is nothing else.</em></p>

<p><em>Plot does not define story. Plot is the framework within which <mark>ideas are explored </mark> and personalities and relationships are unfolded. If all you want is plot, go and read a Tom Clancy novel</em>. ~ Warren Ellis</p>

<p><em><!-- GORILLA (THINKS): --> Why do good things happen to bad people?</em></p>
<p><em>I hate my body.</em></p>
<p><em>Why can't everybody just, y'know, get along?</em></p>
<p><em>Some days are better than others.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.</em></p>
<p><em>Why are you so bitter?</em></p>
