### **His cure for writer's block**

As he laboured over *Les Miserables*, Hugo employed a unique strategy to
force himself to write.

The author removed his clothes and locked himself in an empty room with
nothing but a pen and paper to distract him.Â 

He is said to have ordered his servants not to give him his clothes back
until he had made progress on the novel, which eventually spanned more
than 1,500 pages.
