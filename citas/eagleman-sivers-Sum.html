<p>Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives - by David Eagleman</p>
<p>Date read: 2017-09-27<br />
How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10<br />
Awesomely creative think-piece. 40 very short fictional stories about what happens when you die. The framework is inspiring for anyone: coming up with 40 different answers to any one question. But they’re also just brilliant ideas and powerful little fables. I just read it a 2nd time and love it even more now.</p>
<h2 id="my-notes">my notes</h2>
<p>There are three deaths.<br />
The first is when the body ceases to function.<br />
The second is when the body is consigned to the grave.<br />
The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.<br />
Many people leave just as their loved ones arrive, since the loved ones were the only ones doing the remembering.<br />
He waits with aching heart for his statues to fall.<br />
And that is the curse of this room: since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be.<br />
<br />
The end of death is the death of motivation.<br />
Too much life, it turns out, is the opiate of the masses.<br />
There is a noticeable decline in accomplishment.<br />
People take more naps. There's no great rush.<br />
<br />
Your Creators are talented at just that: creation - but they're not involved with the observation and judgment of our actions, as we had previously supposed them to be.<br />
The Creators watch none of the details as our lives unfold.<br />
They could not care less.<br />
<br />
The you of eight years old has less in common than expected with the you of thirty-two and the you of sixty-four.<br />
The eighteen-year-old you finds more in common with other eighteen-year-olds than with your seventy-three-year-old you.<br />
The seventy-three-year-old you doesn't mind a bit, seeking out meaningful conversations with others of the same generation.<br />
Beyond the name, the yous have little else in common.<br />
<br />
There is bitter competition among the gods.<br />
Jealous rivalries abound because the stakes are so low; the gods are not large and powerful and they know it.<br />
So they try their best to stand out and to be heard.<br />
Some of the humans reach out to make cell phone contact with a single friend out of the innumerable hordes.<br />
And gazing out over the steering wheel, each human feels the intensities of joy and grief as though his were the only real examples in the world.<br />
Among all the creatures of creation, the gods favor us: we are the only ones who can empathize with their problems.<br />
<br />
In the afterlife you can enjoy all possibilities at once, living multiple lives in parallel.<br />
“This,” you tell the angel, “is too much work.”<br />
“Perhaps we could warm you up with a simpler situation,” he considers.<br />
“How would you like to be in a closed room, one-on-one with your lover?”<br />
And then you are here.<br />
You are simultaneously engaged in her conversation and thinking about something else;<br />
she both gives herself to you and does not give herself to you;<br />
you find her objectionable and you deeply love her;<br />
she worships you and wonders what she might have missed with someone else.<br />
“Thank you,” you tell the angel. “This I'm used to.”</p>
<p>Although we credit God with designing man, it turns out He's not sufficiently skilled to have done so. In point of fact, He unintentionally knocked over the first domino.</p>
<p>The Rewarders originally thought to offer it as a gift, but the Punishers quickly decided they could leverage it as a kind of affliction, drying up life's pleasures by revealing their bloodlessly mechanical nature.<br />
<br />
In the afterlife you are judged not against other people, but against yourself.<br />
Specifically, you are judged against what you could have been.<br />
So the afterworld is much like the present world, but it now includes all the yous that could have been.<br />
They made smarter choices, worked harder, invested the extra effort into pushing on closed doors.<br />
These doors eventually broke open for them and allowed their lives to splash out in colorful new directions.<br />
Such success cannot be explained away by a better genetic hand; instead, they played your cards better.<br />
In their parallel lives, they made better decisions, avoided moral lapses, did not give up on love so easily.<br />
They worked harder than you did to correct their mistakes and apologized more often.<br />
You have little sympathy for these less significant yous and more than a little haughtiness about their indolence.<br />
“If you had quit watching TV and gotten off the couch you wouldn't be in this situation,” you tell them, when you bother to interact with them at all.<br />
But the better yous are always in your face in the afterlife.<br />
In the bookstore you'll see one of them arm in arm with the affectionate woman whom you let slip away.<br />
Another you is browsing the shelves, running his fingers over the book he actually finished writing.<br />
And look at this one jogging past outside: he's got a much better body than yours, thanks to a consistency at the gym that you never kept up.<br />
The more you fall short of your potential, the more of these annoying selves you are forced to deal with.<br />
<br />
(Heaven is only people you met:)<br />
The missing crowds make you lonely.<br />
You begin to complain about all the people you could be meeting.<br />
But no one listens or sympathizes with you, because this is precisely what you chose when you were alive.</p>
<p>Perhaps you were tortured by the enormity of the decisions and responsibilities that surrounded you, and now there's only one thing you yearn for: simplicity.<br />
That's permissible.<br />
So for the next round, you choose to be a horse. You covet the bliss of that simple life.<br />
Suddenly, for just a moment, you are aware of the problem you overlooked.<br />
The more you become a horse, the more you forget the original wish.<br />
You forget what it was like to be a human wondering what it was like to be a horse.<br />
You cannot appreciate the destination without knowing the starting point.<br />
You cannot revel in the simplicity unless you remember the alternatives.<br />
And that's not the worst of your revelation.<br />
You realize that the next time you return here, with your thick horse brain, you won't have the capacity to ask to become a human again.<br />
You won't understand what a human is.<br />
Your choice to slide down the intelligence ladder is irreversible.<br />
And just before you lose your final human faculties, you painfully ponder what magnificent extraterrestrial creature, enthralled with the idea of finding a simpler life, chose in the last round to become a human.</p>
<p>It is not the brave who can handle the big face, it is the brave who can handle its absence.<br />
<br />
You were much better at seeing the truth about others than you ever were at seeing yourself.<br />
So you navigated your life with the help of others who held up mirrors for you.<br />
People praised your good qualities and criticized your bad habits, and these perspectives - often surprising to you - helped you to guide your life.<br />
<br />
God said, “The respect I once commanded was caving. So I came up here for the same reason doctors wear uniforms of long white coats. They don't do it for their benefit, but for yours.”</p>
