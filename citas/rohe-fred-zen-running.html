<p>please remember that the point of your running <br> is to help you become <br> healthy, happy and wholly you . <br> consider also accompanying <br> your breath with <br> a prayer (like &quot;God's Grace&quot;) <br> or a mantra (like &quot;Love&quot;) <br> or a question (like &quot;Who am I ?&quot;) <br> or whatever you like -- <br> it's a private affair -- <br> breathing it in and out <br> to your own private running rhythm <br> (for remember, this is your discovery) .</p>
<hr />
<p>what do I mean calling this running <br> &quot;a newly discovered form of meditation ?&quot; <br> Isn't meditation done sitting cross-legged <br> on the floor with closed eyes ?</p>
<hr />
<p>I mean that meditation is a state of being, <br> not a physical position . <br> I can run in a state that is just as meditative,<br> perhaps more so <br> than when sitting Buddha-like .</p>
<hr />
<p>a certain lady whom I love, <br> and for whom I have an immense amount of respect,<br> read what I have written <br> and said that it is beautiful . <br> but, she said, there is something missing . <br> do you really mean, she asked, <br> that it is always joyful, always fun ? <br> no, it is not . <br> what do I do when I don't feel like running, <br> when I feel more like just lying around ? <br> sometimes I do that, I just lie around . <br> and see that about myself . <br> but then, sometimes I push myself out there to run<br> even tho the predominant feeling is , <br> I don't want to . <br> and see that about myself. <br> because there is more than one side <br> to this group I call &quot;myself&quot;. <br> there is no single permanent &quot;I&quot; <br> rather there are many. <br> one &quot;I&quot; wants to quit . <br> usually I keep on running <br> because it's a faster way to get back <br> to where I started from . anyway, the &quot;I&quot; that <br> wanted to run will appear again soon .</p>
<hr />
<p>The troubles with the other books <br> I've seen about running <br> are two :</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>they have a mechanical approach, <br> telling us how far to run <br> how often, how fast <br> as if we are all the same, <br> like a fleet of two-door sedans</li>
</ol>

<p>and</p><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>by making it <br> a mechanical practice <br> the spirit is missing -- <br> there is no fun !
		</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>if there's a beach or a park without a lot of broken glass, do your run barefoot . this gives you a foot massage which stimulates all the nerve reflex points in the soles of your feet , which in turn stimulate all the organs of your body . by being barefoot you also get grounded, this direct contact with Great Mother Earth meaning that electrical equilibrium is established between you and the planet .</p>
<hr />
<p>you can be victimized <br> by your imagination <br> if you imagine yourself <br> astonishing your world <br> with your progress and prowess . <br> we know this mechanism as Ego , <br> we know this state as Ambition .</p>
<p>being Great Runners <br> is not the attainment we need . <br> it is self control . <br> without it, ego forces us into ambition <br> and the price of ambition <br> is pain .</p>
<p>let's not be egotistical , <br> let's take it easy .</p>
