<H2>SF short-shorts: ``Solipsist'' by Fredric Brown</H2>
<p>Walter B. Jehovah, for whose name I make no apology since it
really was his name, had been a solipsist all his life.  A
solipsist, in case you don't happen to know the word, is one who
believes that he himself is the only thing that really exists,
that other people and the universe in general exist only in his
imagination, and that if he quit imagining them, they would cease
to exist.
<p>One day, Walter B. Jehovah became a practicing solipsist.
Within a week, his wife had run away with another man, he'd lost
his job as a shipping clerk and he had broken his leg chasing a
black cat to keep it from crossing his path.
<p>He decided, in a hospital, to end it all.
<p>Looking out the window, staring up at the stars, he wished
them out of existence, and they weren't there anymore.  Then he
wished all other people out of existence, and the hospital became
strangely quiet, even for a hospital.  Next the world, and he
found himself suspended in a void.  He got rid of his body quite
easily and then took the final step of willing <i>himself</i>
out of existence.
<p>Nothing happened.
<p>Strange, he thought, can there be a limit to solipsism?
<p>"Yes," a voice said.
<p>"Who are you??" Walter B. Jehovah asked.
<p>"I am the one who created the universe which you have just
willed out of existence. And now that you have taken my
place"---there was a deep sigh---"I can finally cease my own
existence, find oblivion, and let you take over."
<p>"But---how can <i>I</i> cease to exist? That's what I'm
trying to do, you know."
<p>"Yes, I know," said the voice.  "You must do it the same
way I did.  Create a universe.  Wait until someone in it really
believes what you believed and wills it out of existence.  Then
you can retire and let him take over.  Good-bye now."
<p>And the voice was gone.  Walter B. Jehovah was alone in the
void an there was only one thing he could do.  He created the
heaven and the earth.
<p>It took him seven days.
