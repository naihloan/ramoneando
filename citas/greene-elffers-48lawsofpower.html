<h2 id="law-13-when-asking-for-help-appeal-to-peoples-self-interest-never-to-their-mercy-or-gratitude">Law 13: When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude</h2>
<p>If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.</p>
<h2 id="law-18-do-not-build-fortresses-to-protect-yourself-isolation-is-dangerous">Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself – Isolation is Dangerous</h2>
<p>The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere – everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.</p>
<h2 id="law-25-re-create-yourself">Law 25: Re-Create Yourself</h2>
<p>Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions – your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.</p>
<h2 id="law-29-plan-all-the-way-to-the-end">Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End</h2>
<p>The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End</p>

<h2 id="law-30-make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless">Law 30: Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless</h2>
<h2 id="law-34-be-royal-in-your-own-fashion-act-like-a-king-to-be-treated-like-one">Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one</h2>
<p>The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated; In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.</p>
<h2 id="law-35-master-the-art-of-timing">Law 35: Master the Art of Timing</h2>
<p>Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.</p>
<h2 id="law-36-disdain-things-you-cannot-have-ignoring-them-is-the-best-revenge">Law 36: Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge</h2>
<p>By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.</p>
<h2 id="law-38-think-as-you-like-but-behave-like-others">Law 38: Think as you like but Behave like others</h2>
<p>If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.</p>
<h2 id="law-39-stir-up-waters-to-catch-fish">Law 39: Stir up Waters to Catch Fish</h2>
<p>Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.</p>
<h2 id="law-40-despise-the-free-lunch">Law 40: Despise the Free Lunch</h2>
<p>What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price – there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.</p>
<h2 id="law-42-strike-the-shepherd-and-the-sheep-will-scatter">Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep will Scatter</h2>
<p>Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them – they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.</p>
<h2 id="law-43-work-on-the-hearts-and-minds-of-others">Law 43: Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others</h2>
<p>Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.</p>
<h2 id="law-46-never-appear-too-perfect">Law 46: Never appear too Perfect</h2>
<p>Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.</p>
<h2 id="law-47-do-not-go-past-the-mark-you-aimed-for-in-victory-learn-when-to-stop">Law 47: Do not go Past the Mark you Aimed for; In Victory, Learn when to Stop</h2>
<p>The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.</p>
