<blockquote><ul>
<li><em>You really need to <mark>prioritize</mark> in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack <mark>focus</mark> and your life will be out of balance.</em></li>
<li><em>No matter what, though, I keep up my running. Running every day is a kind of <mark>lifeline</mark> for me, so I’m not going to lay off or quit just because I’m busy. If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I’d never run again. <mark>I have only a few reasons to keep on running, and a truckload of them to quit</mark>. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished.</em></li>
<li><em>Focus - the ability to <mark>concentrate</mark> all your limited talents on whatever’s critical at the moment. <mark>Without that you can’t accomplish anything of value</mark>, while, if you can focus effectively, you’ll be able to compensate for an erratic talent or even a shortage of it. I generally concentrate on work for three or four hours every morning. I sit at my desk and focus totally on what I’m writing. I don’t see anything else, I don’t think about anything else.</em></li>
<li><em>Endurance. If you concentrate on writing three or four hours a day and feel tired after a week of this, you’re not going to be able to write a long work. <mark>What’s needed for a writer</mark> of fiction - at least one who hopes to write a novel - <mark>is the energy to focus every day for half a year, or a year, two years</mark>.</em></li>
<li><em>Raymond Chandler once confessed that even if he didn’t write anything, he made sure he sat down at his desk every single day and concentrated. I understand the purpose behind his doing this. This is the way Chandler gave himself <mark>the physical stamina a professional writer needs, quietly strengthening his willpower</mark>. This sort of daily training is indispensable.</em></li>
<li><em>As an action that deviates from the ordinary yet doesn’t violate basic values, you’d expect it to afford you a special sort of self-awareness. It should add a few new elements to your inventory in understanding who you are. And as a result, your view of your life, its colors and shape, should be transformed.</em></li>
