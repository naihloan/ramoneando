<h2>Fight Club</h2>
<!-- by Chuck Palahniuk. Vintage books, 1997. Croydon, Surrey, UK. -->

<!-- chap 6. p. 50 -->

<!-- chap 6. p. 49 -->
<p>Someday I'd be dead without a scar. [...] Nothing is static. Even the <em>Mona Lisa</em> is falling apart.<br>
Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer.<br><!-- Tyler never knew his father. -->
Maybe self-destruction is the answer.</p>

<!-- chap 6. p. 50 -->
<p>Fight club is not football on television. You aren't watching a bunch of men you don't know halfway around the world beating on each other live by satelite with a two-minute delay, commercials pitching beer every ten minutes, and a pause now for station identification. After you've been to fight club, watching football on television is watching pornography when you could be having great sex.</p>

<!-- chap 6. p. 51 -->
<p>carved out of wood. This guy trusts himself to handle anything. [...] when you wake up Sunday afternoon you feel saved.</p>

<!-- chap 6. p. 52 -->
<p> At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.</p>

<!-- p. 53 -->
<p>We both stood there [...] knowing we'd gotten somewhere we'd never been and [...] wanted to see how far we could take this thing and still be alive. <br> I felt finally I could get my hands on everything in the world that didn't work.
</p>

<p>Nothing was solved when the fight was over, but nothing mattered.</p>
