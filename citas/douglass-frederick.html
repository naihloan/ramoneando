<em>
<p>If there is no struggle, there is no progress.</p>
<p>It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.</p>
<p>Jefferson was not ashamed to call the black man his brother and to address him as a gentleman.</p>
<p>Men of mixed blood in this country apply the name “negro” to themselves, not because it is a correct ethnological description, but to seem especially devoted to the black side of their parentage.</p>
<p>Whatever the future may have in store for us, one thing is certain... Human thought will never go backward. When a great truth once gets abroad in the world, no power on earth can imprison it, or prescribe its limits, or suppress it. It is bound to go on till it becomes the thought of the world... Now that it has got fairly fixed in the minds of the few, it is bound to become fixed in the minds of the many, and be supported at last by a great cloud of witnesses, which no man can number and no power can withstand.</p>
<p>Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.</p>
